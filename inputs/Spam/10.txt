Hello Developer,

We hope this email finds you well. We are a research group at UC Davis under Professor Vladimir Filkov and we would greatly appreciate your participation in our survey.

Our study is investigating the burden of use in relation to npm packages and what features users find most helpful when using and contributing to projects.
We have a 5-10 min survey and because of your contribution to @adrianepi/addlogging, we believe your opinion would be highly valuable.

If you provide your email at the end of the survey we will send you the results and our analysis.

Thank you for your time
