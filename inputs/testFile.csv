SPAM,    Hello!   As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $529 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: &#8220;Buy Bitcoin&#8221;).   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 18eBGkYam1wjz1S77jz3VmADuYYFzhA3vB   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best wishes!

SPAM,    Hello!   As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $735 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 11wQFVQ65DdfzWXqup3JdY7prFazMbXjc   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!

SPAM,    <http://actripeatin.tk/zimiv>     If you can dream it; then you can achieve it. You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.    You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new dream.    If you want light to come into your life; you need to stand where it is shining.    There is little difference in people; but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.

SPAM,        As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $748 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1GoWy5yMzh3XXBiYxLU9tKCBMgibpznGio   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!

SPAM,    Desmond Bikkoh 158 Jan Smuts Avenue ZA 2196 Rosebank South Africa Fax:086 665 3727. Email:desmondbikkoh@workmail.co.za Dear Sir/Madam; Guten Tag; mein Name ist Mr. Desmond Bikkoh ; Chef Editor der First  Naional Bank of South Africa (FNB). Ich war ein sehr enger Freund von  Thomas Frie; StaatsbÃ¼rger ihres Landes. HerrFrie arbeitete mit einer  Mienennentwicklungsfirma in Zimbabwe zusammen. Am 21 Mai 2005  verunglÃ¼ckte Herr Frie mit seiner Familie bei einem Autounfall. Sie  befanden sich auf den Weg von Zimbabwe nach SÃ¼d Afrika um den Befehl von  PrÃ¤sident Robert Mugabe  die HÃ¤user der Mitglieder der Oppositions  Partei zu zerstÃ¶ren (Operation Murambatsvina) zu entkommen. Alle  Insassen des Autos starben bei dem Unfall. Seit dem habe ich zahlreiche  Erkundigungen bei Ihrer Botschaft hier in SÃ¼d Afrika angestellt um  Verwandte von Herr Frie ausfindig zu machen. Leider war ich bisher  erfolglos. Nach zahlreichen ergebnisslosen Versuchen Herr Frie's  Verwandten  ausfindig zu machen; habe ich mich entschieden Ihren Namen /Addresse  Ã¼bers German dasoertliche site ausfindig zu machen; da sie die gleiche  NationalitÃ¤t haben.  Ich habe Sie kontaktiert um Ihnen dabei zu  assistieren  Anspruch auf einen  Betrag von 10 Millionen US Dollar;  hinterlassen von meinem Freund Thomas Frie zu erheben; bevor es von der  First National Bank of South Africa konfeziert wird . Die First National  Bank of South Afrika hat mich benachrichtigt das ich einen Verwandten  ausfindig machen muss oder das Geld wird innerhalb der nÃ¤chsten 21  Arbeitstagen konfesziert. In meiner Position als Chef Editor der First  National Bank of South Afrika ist es mir MÃ¶glich das Geld auf ein  gÃ¼ltiges auslÃ¤ndisches Konto zu Ã¼berweien  mit der Sicherung das das  Geld komplett sein wird bis ich in Ihr Land komme um das Geld mit Ihnen   zu teilen. Da es mir  seit  zwei Jahren nicht gelungen ist Verwandschaft von Herr  Frie ausfindig zu machen;  versuche ich Ihr EinverstÃ¤ndnis zu bekommen  Sie als nÃ¤chste Verwandten des Verstorbenen zu prÃ¤sentieren da Sie die  gleiche NationalitÃ¤t haben und somit das Geld zu Ihnen Ã¼berwiesen werden  kann. Wenn Sie an meinen Vorschlag interessiert sind; kÃ¶nnen wir die  TeilungsverhÃ¤ltnisse und UberweisungsmodalitÃ¤ten besprechen. Ich besitze  alle nÃ¶tigen Informationen und gesetzlichen Dokumente um Ihre  Anspruchsforderung zu unterstÃ¼tzen falls Se sich dazu entscheiden. Ich brauche nur Ihre ehrliche Zustimmung zur Zusammenarbeit um uns  diese Transaktion zu ermÃ¶glichen. Ich garantiere Ihnen auch das dies nur  unter legalen/ gesetzlichen Vorraussetzungen stattfinden wird. Bitte kontaktiren Sie mich unter meiner  Email:desmondbikkoh@workmail.co.za; order Fax schicken: 002786 665 3727 Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼ssen Desmond Bikkoh.

SPAM,    Hi; your account has been infected! Renew the password this time!   You do not know anything about me and you may be probably surprised for what reason you're reading this particular letter; proper?   I'm hacker who exploitedyour emailand all devicesnot so long ago. Never try out to msg me or alternatively seek for me; it's impossible; because I forwarded you this message using YOUR hacked account.   I've installed special program on the adult videos (porno) site and guess that you visited this site to have fun (you understand what I mean).   While you have been keeping an eye on video clips; your internet browser started out to act like a RDP (Remote Control) having a keylogger that provided me access to your screen and network camera.   Then; my softobtainedall information. You have typed passcodes on the online resources you visited; I caught them. Surely; you are able change each of them; or have already modified them. However it doesn't matter; my program renews needed data regularly.   What actually I have done? I generated a reserve copy of every your system. Of all the files and each contact. I formed a dual-screen videofile. The first part displays the film that you were watching (you have got an interesting preferences; ahahhh...); and the second screen displays the recording from your own camera.   What exactly should you do? Clearly; I think; $723(USD) will be a fair price for our small riddle. You will make the deposit by bitcoins (if you do not understand this; go searching "how to purchase bitcoin" in any search engine).   My bitcoin wallet address: 12s4cfoNTzT68gSdxLjmSRT3qdvaqwDWNz (It is cAsE sensitive; so copy and paste it).   Important: You will have 2 days in order to make the payment. (I have an unique pixel in this letter; and at the moment I understand that you've read through this email).   To tracethe reading of a messageand the actionsin it; I utilizea Facebook pixel.   Thanks to them. (That whichis usedfor the authorities may helpus.)   In case I fail to get bitcoins; I shall undoubtedly send your video files to each of your contacts; along with relatives; co-workers; etc?

SPAM,    Hello!   I have very bad news for you. 21/10/2018 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org   So; you can change the password; yes... But my malware intercepts it every time.   How I made it: In the software of the router; through which you went online; was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online; my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.   After that; I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book; history of viewing sites; all files; phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).   A month ago; I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit; and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults.   I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!   And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about; huh?). After that; I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!   I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends; relatives or colleagues. I think $702 is a very; very small amount for my silence. Besides; I have been spying on you for so long; having spent a lot of time!   Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 1H1K8MfLEJgjCCfDEkTJmv9GJjD3XzEFGR   You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: "how to replenish btc wallet". It's extremely easy   For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened; the timer will work.   After payment; my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount; then your device will be locked; and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your "enjoys".   I hope you understand your situation.

I write to solicit for your partnership in claiming of $47 Million from a Financial Home in Cambodia.   The aforementioned fund $47 Million is my share percentage from my Oil/Gas deal with Cambodia/Vietnam Government within  2013/2014; influentially I don't want my government to know about the fund.

Be informed that nobody knows about the secret of this fund except me and I know how to carry out the entire transaction.

I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount involved as gratification for being my partner in the transfer.

SPAM,    Hello!   I hacked your device; because I sent you this message from your account. If you have already changed your password; my malware will be intercepts it every time.   You may not know me; and you are most likely wondering why you are receiving this email; right? In fact; I posted a malicious program on adults (pornography) of some websites; and you know that you visited these websites to enjoy  (you know what I mean).   While you were watching video clips; my trojan started working as a RDP (remote desktop) with a keylogger that gave me access to your screen as well as a webcam.   Immediately after this; my program gathered all your contacts from messenger; social networks; and also by e-mail.   What I've done? I made a double screen video. The first part shows the video you watched (you have good taste; yes ... but strange for me and other normal people); and the second part shows the recording of your webcam.   What should you do?   Well; I think $720 (USD dollars) is a fair price for our little secret. You will make a bitcoin payment (if you don't know; look for "how to buy bitcoins" on Google).   BTC Address: 14DvFghvkzQujf5Kd5AL2VKjxaYm5KidxR (This is CASE sensitive; please copy and paste it)   Remarks: You have 2 days (48 hours) to pay. (I have a special code; and at the moment I know that you have read this email).   If I don't get bitcoins; I will send your video to all your contacts; including family members; colleagues; etc. However; if I am paid; I will immediately destroy the video; and my trojan will be destruct someself.   If you want to get proof; answer "Yes!" and resend this letter to youself.  And I will definitely send your video to your any 16 contacts.   This is a non-negotiable offer; so please do not waste my personal and other people's time by replying to this email.   Bye!

SPAM,    <http://smerwoo.ga/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable; or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.    When I do good; I feel good. When I do bad; I feel bad. That's my religion.    If opportunity doesn't knock; build a door.

You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.    You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new dream.    I do believe we're all connected. I do believe in positive energy. I do believe in the power of prayer. I do believe in putting good out into the world. And I believe in taking care of each other.    There is little difference in people; but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.

As a married Arab women serving as a minister; there is a limit to my personal income and investment level.

The amount is valued at $47;745;533.00 United States dollars with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund.   If you can handle the fund in a good investment; get back to me for more details on this email; ( hashimireemz101@naver.com ) Sincerely; Ms. Reem.

SPAM,    <http://banptor.ml/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Life has many ways of testing a person's will; either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.    When the world pushes you to your knees; you're in the perfect position to pray.    The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.    If someone tells you; You can't.      Best Regards      
SPAM,    Dear Friend; I know this means of communication may not be morally right to you as a person but I also have had a great thought about it and I have come to this conclusion which I am about to share with you.   INTRODUCTION: I am a banker and in one way or the other was hoping you will cooperate with me as a partner in a project of transferring an abandoned fund of a late customer of the bank worth of $18;000;000 (Eighteen Million Dollars US). This will be disbursed or shared between the both of us in these percentages; 45% for me and 45% for you while 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring of the funds into your bank account.   Also according to the agreement if the payment year expires and the account holder or partner wishes to claim the said funds; the claimer has to re-activate the account. The cost of the re-activation will be paid by both of us.   Contact me immediately if that is alright for you so that we can enter in agreement before we start processing for the transfer of the funds. If you are satisfied with this proposal; please provide the below details for the Mutual Confidential Agreement: 1. Full Name and Address 2. Occupation and Country of Origin 3. Telephone Number and Next of Kin   I wait for your response so that we can commence on this project as soon as possible. Regards; Mr.Omar Aziz

SPAM,      Dear Friend;   I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise since we have not known or met before now; but please; I would like you to treat it like blood brother affair and with the urgency and secrecy it requires. I am Mr. Hassan Alwan Ali; an Audit staff of (C.B.N) Central Bank of Nigeria.     An investor (name with-held) died without naming any next of kin to his fund he deposited in my bank. The amount is $10.5M ( Ten million five hundred united state dollars ) and banking regulation/legislation in Nigeria demands that I should notify the fiscal authorities after three years.   The above set of facts underscores my reason to seek your permission to have you stand in as the next of kin to the deceased.   This fund will be approved and released in your favour as the next of kin if only you will adhere to my instruction and cooperate with me in one accord.   I have all the legal and banking details of the deceased client that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer of the $10.5M plus interest to any bank account nominated by you.   I am prepared to compensate you with a 35% share of the total funds for your efforts. The final details will be given upon receipt an affirmation of your desire to participate.   Please contact me immediately on ( hassan_alwanali01@yahoo.com  ) if you are interest in my proposal to enable me not to start scouting for another foreign partner.   Thanks; Mr. Hassan Alwan Ali.

SPAM,    <http://seprated.tk/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Today is a new beginning; a chance to turn your failures into achievements & your sorrows into so goods. No room for excuses.    We are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish ourselves to be; we have the power to make ourselves.    I do believe we're all connected. I do believe in positive energy. I do believe in the power of prayer. I do believe in putting good out into the world. And I believe in taking care of each other.    Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree; you still believe it to be a beautiful place.      Best Regards

SPAM,    <http://seprated.cf/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     I may not have gone where I intended to go; but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.    I am the greatest; I said that even before I knew I was.    With everything that has happened to you; you can either feel sorry for yourself or treat what has happened as a gift. Everything is either an opportunity to grow or an obstacle to keep you from growing. You get to choose.    Success is falling nine times and getting up ten.      Best Regards

SPAM,    <http://zakolote.ml/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.    The will to win; the desire to succeed; the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.    We are all here for some special reason. Stop being a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future.    Whatever you want to do; do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.      Best Regards

SPAM,    Schöne Grüße!!   Als erstes; möchte ich Ihnen um Ihre vertrauen in diese Transaktion bitten; diese ist völlig vertraulich und streng Geheim. Doch ich weiß dass; die Transaktion auf diese Größe; jeder besorgt und beunruhigt machen kann; aber ich versichere Ihnen; das am Ende alles gut laufen wird.Ich werde anfangen; indem ich mich anständig vorstelle. Es wird Ihnen sicherlich überraschen diesen Brief zu erhalten; da wir vorher keine Absprache hatte. Mein name ist Pedro Moreira; die Berater des verstorbenen Herr Richard <mf:Lastname> aus Deutschland. Meine Absicht Sie zu kontaktieren geht darum; Ihre Mitwirkung um die Geld von unserer verstorbenen Kunde zu sichern; und zu verhindern das es nicht von der Bank beschlagnahmend oder verzollt wird; wo das Geld in Wert von 6.950.000.00 Millionen Euro von der verstorbene eingezahlt wurde; bevor er starb.   Die Bank hat mir eine Notiz ausgefertigt eine Nachfolger Verwandtschaft zu kontaktieren; sonst wird das Geld an der Bank Eigentum umgeleitet. Bislang; habe ich mit aller meine Mühe versucht jemanden zu kontaktieren; der mit den verstorbene in Verwandtschaft steht; dies war leider erfolglos. Aus diesem Grund habe ich sie kontaktiert. Eigentlich; bitte ich Sie um Ihre Einwilligung; Sie der Bank als der Nachfolger Verwandt/Besitzerin des Geldes unsere verstorbene Kunde zu repräsentieren; da Sie den gleichen Nachname haben und somit wird der Betrag an Ihnen gezahlt.   Alle legale Dokumente; die sie benötigen um Sie zu unterstützen und den Anspruch als meinen Mandant Nachfolger Verwandtschaft zu erhalten; werde ich ihnen zur Verfügung stellen. Um diese Transaktion zu ermöglichen; alles was ich brauche ist eine ehrliche Zusammenarbeit. Ich möchte vorschlagen; dass 20% von dem Geld an Hilfsorganisation verschenkt wird; während das übliche 80 % gleichmäßig an uns verteilt wird. Ich möchte ihnen vergewissern; dass dieser Auftrag völlig Risikofrei ist. Ich werde meine Position als Berater des verstobenes die Transaktion erfolgreich durchführen.   Die geplante Transaktion wird unter eine autorisierte Anordnung durchgeführt; was Sie schützen wird.Falls das Geschäftsleben nicht Ihre Moral entspricht; dann bitte ich Sie meine Entschuldigung zu akzeptieren. Falls Sie im Gegenteil wünschen mit mir dieses Ziel zu Erringen; dann bitte ich Sie für weitere Detail mit mir kontakt aufzunehmen.    Mit freundlichen Grüßen; Herr Pedro Moreira.

SPAM,    Donatie Van Mvr Marija Sterbenc   Liefste in de Heer;   Met alle respect en menselijkheid werd ik gedwongen te schrijven op een  humanitair gebied.   Ik ben een weduwe Marija Sterbenc die langdurige zieken (kanker)  veroudert. Zijn momenteel opgenomen in een privÃ©ziekenhuis. Ik heb wat  geld dat ik heb geÃ«rfd van myhusband; Anthony Sterbenc; die later stierf  bij een auto-ongeluk.   Toen mijn man in leven was; deponeerde hij de som van â‚¬ 4.500.000;00  (4.500.000;00 Euro) in een bank. Momenteel staat dit geld nog steeds op  de bank.   Mijn arts zei me dat het de komende drie maanden niet zou aanhouden  vanwege het kankerprobleem. Ik heb iemand nodig die heel eerlijk en  godvrezend is en die deze gelden kan gebruiken voor het werk van God.  Mijn overleden man heeft geleerd dat dit fonds voor  liefdadigheidsdoeleinden moet worden gebruikt. ; zoals het bouwen van  scholen; huizen van weeshuizen; ziekenhuizen; enz.   Ik nam deze beslissing omdat ik geen kind heb dat dit geld zal erven en  ik wil dat God mij genadig is en mijn ziel accepteert. Met God zijn alle  dingen mogelijk. Alsjeblieft; als je in staat zou zijn om deze fondsen  te gebruiken voor Gods werk; reageer dan alstublieft op mijn id: met dit  e-mailadres: (marijasterbenc55@gmail.com)   Ik wil dat je me de volgende informatie toestuurt waarnaar hieronder  wordt verwezen.   Je volledige naam ----------------------- Jouw land ------------------------- Jouw adres -------------------------- Jouw leeftijd ------------------------------ Uw dienstverband ----------------------- De telefoon ------------------------ Zodra ik uw antwoord heb ontvangen; zal ik u het contact van de bank  geven en ik zal u ook een machtigingsbrief geven die u laat zien dat u  de huidige begunstigde van dit fonds bent.   In de hoop uw antwoord te ontvangen. Blijf gezegend in de Heer.   Dank je   Met vriendelijke groet   Mevrouw Marija Sterbenc

SPAM,      Hello Dear Friend;   My name is Mr.Tansoba kanbu. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation  with you in the execution of the deal described here-under for our both  mutual benefit and I hope you will keep it a top secret because of the nature  of the transaction; During the course of our bank year auditing; I discovered  an unclaimed/abandoned fund; sum total of {US$19.3 Million United State  Dollars} in the bank account that belongs to a Saudi Arabia businessman Who unfortunately lost his life and entire family in a Motor Accident.   Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for the claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful in locating any of the relatives; now; I sincerely seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at {US$19.3 Million United State Dollars} can be paid to you; which we will share in these percentages ratio; 60% to me and 40% to you. All I request is your utmost sincere co-operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to achieve this project successfully. I have carefully mapped out the moralities for execution of this transaction under a legitimate arrangement to protect you from any breach of the law both in your country and here in Burkina Faso when the fund is being transferred to your bank account.   I will have to provide all the relevant document that will be requested to indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this legacy and our bank will release the fund to you without any further delay; upon your consideration and acceptance of this offer; please send me the following information as stated below so we can proceed and get this fund transferred to your designated bank account immediately.

SPAM,    It was a Monday like every other when Sean Johnson showed up for his morning shift at the Marriott Hotel.   He worked at the Valet Parking for over 3 years; but the news he received that morning would change his life forever.   Sean was browsing Facebook one afternoon and saw an advertisement saying she could earn $3;959 per day from home. The ad was about the Bitcoin Revolution. Curious he clicked on it and did some research.   â€œIt had some excellent reviews from a lot of users; so I felt safer signing up for the system. It is not like those â€˜get rich quickâ€™ scams where you have to sell things to make a living. If I did have to sell things I would not have signed upâ€ Sean shared.   Using the internet to work from home has become one of the largest worldwide trends and has recently exploded all over the world. The Bitcoin Revolution is an auto-trading software created by a start-up that teaches you to trade currencies to make money online.   â€œI was nervous about starting the system. I do not know the computer very well; but they teach you how to do everything you need to know."   After his first two weeks using the system; two deposits arrived in his Paypal account totaling $50;446   When Sean saw the money coming in like this he knew it for sure that the Bitcoin Revolution was for real.   For the next 2 months Sean went to work like normal. Whenever he had a spare moment he worked on the Bitcoin Revolution system.   With his earnings growing everyday; it was finally time to quit his job. He told his boss he wasnâ€™t coming to work tomorrow.     Below is how he got on: http://www.squashjust.icu/Jeedm/mzyz574bauth/qNsZnQeRnuYJF-E0yBtBi72eflav8kd0wuNOCuQa_nA/Ts26d70_uDsoeWsJIxdwp9uLCPblXkoFDCVuiAjTAJ-dOuu-bHs54CW3Uii79ODKs8v9yyBz2pa2aPPLxzD4YOvH_X4Dl2tgc95vOXTyrdmPpgP9IzQphlYdGEwGJ9KNNt6ZGg7tOvj5X4x3Fon5Pr8LCWzFvqFZ2x36-Bx7zXGBWFVblweDqmqhmEEjtUAL     You can be removed from my list by visiting the below link or writing to me at@   BTC Revolution 28 W.

SPAM,    Yeah. I know you are a pedophile. Actually I know way more about you than you think.   I am a computer scientist (internet security specialist) with affiliation with the Anonymous group.   Few months ago you downloaded an application. That application had a special code implanted purposely. Since the moment you installed it; your device started to act like a Remote Desktop I was able to access anytime.   The program allowed me to access your desktop; your camera(s); your files; passwords and contact lists. I also know where you live and where you work..     I was observing you for quite some time and what I have collected here is overwhelming. I know about your sexual preferences and your interest in young bodies.   I have secured 4 video files clearly showing how you mÉ‘sturbate (captured from your camera) to young teenagers (captured from your internet browser). Glued together is a pretty overwhelming evidence that you are a pedophile.   The timestamps on the video files indicate the exact time you have been mÉ‘sturbating to teenagers: Bruce_untroubled_org_1561674055.mp4 (23.3 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1562940994.mp4 (99.8 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1561527084.mp4 (91.9 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1560425551.mp4 (15.8 MB)     I am not here to judge the morality of your sexual preferences; I am here to make money. Because I know you are a wealthy person and that you do care about your reputation; I am willing to gÎ¯ve you a chance to atone and I will leave you alone.   You do know what Bitcoin is; right ?   You must fund a special address with 5;000 Ã™SD in Bitcoin; otherwise; I am going to seÆžd those video files to your family members; friends and your work buddies.   I know it may be time consuming to buy 5;000 Ã™SD in bitcoin; so I will gÎ¯ve you exÉ‘ctly one week. Search on google 'how to buy bitcoin' and seÆžd it to me. Enough is enough. I have seen enough..     If you do not Ð…eÆžd the bitcoins in one week; I will also Ð…eÆžd those video recordings to your local police office. Your life will be ruined; trust me. Æ¬rÉ‘nsfer details are below..

SPAM,    Hello!   I am a hacker who has access to your operating system. I also have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site = that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other=  device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camer= a and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 ho= urs so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of th= e screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails = and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messenger= s that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know = how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  3Pm7PhvesXXSe3Rui6kMK5LPyxG5FC9mC=     After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will neve= r hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you = see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email ca= nnot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the vid= eo will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!  
SPAM,    Hi; dear user of lists.untroubled.org   We have installed one RAT software into you device  For this moment your email account is hacked too.   Changed your password? You're doing great! But my software recognizes every such action. I'm updating passwords! I'm always one step ahead....   So... I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence. The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.   I posted EternalBlue Exploit modification on porn site; and then you installed my malicious code (trojan) on your operation system. When you clicked the button Play on porn video; at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device. After installation; your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate; in addition; the software is synchronized with the video you choose.   For the moment; the software has harvrested all your contact information from social networks and email addresses. If you need to erase all of your collected data and video with your enjoy; send me $600(usd) in BTC (crypto currency).   This is my Bitcoin wallet: 15GWKdT8e1o6GcDTZMQZRiZng2Q6dLX8Aw You have 48 hours after reading this letter.   After your transaction I will erase all your data. Otherwise; I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues; friends and relatives!!!   P.S. I'm asking you - not to answer this letter because the sender's address is fake; just to keep me incognito.   And henceforth be more careful! Please visit only secure sites! Bye;Bye...

SPAM,    Hello Dear Friend. I=E2=80=99m  Mrs. Stellar Maoris  a manger in  HSBC  bank  of  Spain Madrid=   am sending this brief letter  to seek for  your partnership and long term relationship=   I have an important and urgent issue I want to discuss with you privately a= bout Transaction fund worth the sum of $9.5m America dollars left by most of the greedy Asia Kuwait politician in our bank here in Spain Madrid; A fund which suppose to have been use to develop the continent.   If you know that you can invest this fund into profitable business in your country by the end we shall have 50%50 share each; kindly get back to me for more detail and procedures.   Your urgent respond will be highly appreciated Awaiting to hear from you asap. My Regard. Stellar Maoris Email: stellerbarid@barid.com Phone Number:  +34(62) 768 5146  
SPAM,    Dear;   I was shocked you stopped communicating me; I really can't understand your reason for doing so; but I am very happy now to inform you about my success in getting the fund out of the bank with the help of a staff working in the remittance office and also with the special assistance of a French business woman that catered for other logistics.   However; I left the sum of $800;000 (Eight Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars Only) in an ATM cash withdrawal Card. This $800;000 is for you and it is purposely for your compensation for your little effort in this transaction. The ATM Card is a global payment card which is acceptable; workable and usable worldwide in making daily withdrawal of money from any ATM location.  So you can be able to make withdrawals of money in any countries on daily basis.   I would have sent the ATM card to your address by myself; but I lack the time to do that now because I have to urgently meet up with my business colleagues in Russia. I will be heading to the airport as soon as I send you this email because I will be traveling out of my country to Russia where I shall continue with a petroleum business engagements.   For your good; I left the ATM card with one Mrss.Sumon; now go on and contact him through his email address so that he can dispatch to you the ATM card at your contact address.  Simply contact Mrss.Sumon immediately so that he can send the ATM card to you. Below is the contact of Mrss.Sumon;   E-Mail:  mrsceline.sumon@yandex.com   Name:    Mrss Celine Sumon   I will no longer be able to email you again.   Bye and best regards;   Mr Ududonka Ahmed.

SPAM,    Hello!   I am very sorry for the trouble and for this letter! But I have no other choice!   My name is Narges; I am transgender and live in Iran. It's no secret that Iran is the most homophobic country in the world. Representatives of LGBT communities are criminally prosecuted in our country and hated fiercely. They can even be executed in public.   In our country; a real hell for homosexuals.   In remote areas of the country; LGBT people are beaten; tortured; raped and even executed with shocking regularity. Thanks to a 1987 bill that legalized sexual change; parents of homosexual children regularly force them to undergo hormonal treatment against their will; and for the sex change operation; local bandits kill.   Recently; my beloved Gul was kidnapped by police and asked for a ransom; otherwise she would face a death penalty (before that she had already been lashed).   These scum are asking for 25 thousand dollars.   I ask all LGBT people and just kind people to help us in this trouble. I want to redeem my beloved and flee from this damned country to civilization; where we can live in peace!   Every dollar is important to us; help as much as you can! If suddenly everything works out; then I plan to fight this situation in Iran and make an LGBT fund for compatriots.   My friend is a programmer. He advised me to write and send this email to different people and ask for money in bitcoins. Since it is absolutely anonymous for me and for you. He also said that it is very easy to replenish.   Here is my btc wallet (if your really ready): bc1qlq7z2xy4tw0wd46lnsexq9fgqquuryus2x5txw   Peace to your home.

SPAM,    I greet you!   I have bad news for you. 11/06/2019 - on this day I hacked your operating system and got full access to your account bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org   It is useless to change the password; my malware intercepts it every time.   How it was: In the software of the router to which you were connected that day; there was a vulnerability. I first hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you entered in the Internet; my trojan was installed on the operating system of your device.   After that; I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book; history of viewing sites; all files; phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).   A month ago; I wanted to lock your device and ask for a small amount of money to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit; and came to the big delight of your favorite resources. I'm talking about sites for adults.   I want to say - you are a big pervert. You have unbridled fantasy!   After that; an idea came to my mind. I made a screenshot of the intimate website where you have fun (you know what it is about; right?). After that; I took off your joys (using the camera of your device). It turned out beautifully; do not hesitate.   I am strongly belive that you would not like to show these pictures to your relatives; friends or colleagues. I think $709 is a very small amount for my silence. Besides; I spent a lot of time on you!   I accept money only in Bitcoins. My BTC wallet: 1PKQvF9qK3zuB8KVwmDVDUxtpUVfE1P6fp   You do not know how to replenish a Bitcoin wallet? In any search engine write "how to send money to btc wallet". It's easier than send money to a credit card!   For payment you have a little more than two days (exactly 50 hours). Do not worry; the timer will start at the moment when you open this letter. Yes; yes .. it has already started!   After payment; my virus and dirty photos with you self-destruct automatically. Narrative; if I do not receive the specified amount from you; then your device will be blocked; and all your contacts will receive a photos with your "joys".   I want you to be prudent.

SPAM,    Hello Dear;   Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually; I came across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my final wish before i die.   Meanwhile; I am Mrs.  Nicole Martha 62 years old; from France; and I am suffering from a long time cancer and from all indication my condition is really deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me that I may not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my tumor has reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical treatment. As a matter of fact; registered nurse by profession while my husband was dealing on Gold Dust and Gold Dory Bars in Burkina Faso till his sudden death the year 2008 then I took over his business till date.   In fact; at this moment I have a deposit sum of four million five hundred thousand US dollars [$4;500;000.00] with one of the leading bank in Burkina Faso but unfortunately I cannot visit the bank since I m critically sick and powerless to do anything myself but my bank account officer advised me to assign any of my trustworthy relative; friends or partner with authorization letter to stand as the recipient of my money but sorrowfully I don t have any reliable relative and no child.   Therefore; I want you to receive the money and take 50% to take care of yourself and family while 50% should be use basically on humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages home; Motherless babies home; less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the world. and as soon as I receive your I shall send you my pictures; banking records and with full contacts of my banking institution to communicate them on the matter. Please contact me with these email address.( nicolemartha247@gmail.com)   Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Faithfully; Mrs.  Nicole Martha

SPAM,    Dear Ruben Safir;   	I would like to ask you if you could do your friend a favor. Your man  Richard Matthew Stallman. From my observation you and he are from the  same community; if you understand my meaning. What RMS probably needs is  very simple; something all men need: a young bride.   	Now; the reform/liberal synagogue known as the FSF hasn't helped him  out in this needed way; infact some of their number have behaved; how  shall we say; as a congregation that is adversarial to RMS: a  congregation of adversary; (you can translate that to another language  or two and understand that meaning in a more coloured way (translate it  to hebrew; the word adversary))   	You seem like an orthodox man; a mensch perhaps. Is not RMS a mensch in  the way he has helped so many? So could you help him out;  community-member to community-member? (Wrj gb Wrj). You could get a nice  girl from Israel; in an orthodox economically challenged living space;  who's humble; cute; young; and nice: and have RMS say "sayonorah" to the  country that hates him: America (and the people that hate him (whites.))   	Look: words are nice; sometimes they hurt; but they aren't nothing: but  they are very little. You know what your friend needs; your fellow.  Please just make it happen. Does RMS have to be tortured till his dying  day never feeling wanted? Comon; help your guy out.   Sincerely; Some guy.  
SPAM,    From:Miss: Fatima Yusuf.   For sure this mail would definitely come to you as a surprise; but do take your good time to go through it; My name is Ms. Fatima Yusuf;i am from Ivory Coast.   I lost my parents a year and couple of months ago. My father was a serving director of the Agro-exporting board until his death. He was assassinated by his business partners.Before his death; he made a deposit of US$9.7 Million Dollars here in Cote d'ivoire which was for the purchase of cocoa processing machine and development of another factory before his untimely death.   Being that this part of the world experiences political and crises time without number; there is no guarantee of lives and properties. I cannot invest this money here any long; despite the fact it had been my late father's industrial plans.   I want you to do me a favor to receive this funds into your country or any safer place as the beneficiary; I have plans to invest this money in continuation with the investment vision of my late father; but not in this place again rather in your country. I have the vision of going into real estate and industrial production or any profitable business venture.   I will be ready to compensate you with 20% of the total Amount; now all my hope is banked on you and i really wants to invest this money in your country; where there is stability of Government; political and economic welfare.   My greatest worry now is how to move out of this country because my uncle is threatening to kill me as he killed my father;Please do not let anybody hear about this; it is between me and you alone because of my security reason.   I am waiting to hear from you. Yours Sincerely; Miss.Fatima Yusuf.

SPAM,    Dear;   I was shocked you stopped communicating me; I really can't understand your reason for doing so; but I am very happy now to inform you about my success in getting the fund out of the bank with the help of a staff working in the remittance office and also with the special assistance of a French business woman that catered for other logistics.   However; I left the sum of $800;000 (Eight Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars Only) in an ATM cash withdrawal Card. This $800;000 is for you and it is purposely for your compensation for your little effort in this transaction. The ATM Card is a global payment card which is acceptable; workable and usable worldwide in making daily withdrawal of money from any ATM location.  So you can be able to make withdrawals of money in any countries on daily basis.   I would have sent the ATM card to your address by myself; but I lack the time to do that now because I have to urgently meet up with my business colleagues in Russia. I will be heading to the airport as soon as I send you this email because I will be traveling out of my country to Russia where I shall continue with a petroleum business engagements.   For your good; I left the ATM card with one Mrss.Sumon; now go on and contact him through his email address so that he can dispatch to you the ATM card at your contact address.  Simply contact Mrss.Sumon immediately so that he can send the ATM card to you. Below is the contact of Mrss.Sumon;   E-Mail:  mrsceline.sumon@yandex.com   Name:    Mrss Celine Sumon   I will no longer be able to email you again.   Bye and best regards;   Mr Ududonka Ahmed.

SPAM,     Greetings My Dear;       I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Mrs. Doris David a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of ($ 11;000;000.00; Eleven Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Doris David.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11.3million immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.   I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased customer (the account owner) who died a long with his supposed NEXT OF KIN since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 15 years; because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.   By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.   Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.   Best Regards; Mr. Duna Wattara.

SPAM,    If you've been diagnosed with type-2-diabetes or pre-diabetes; you're proba= bly up to your eyeballs with diabetes information.   Every doc ; health researcher; and even well-meaning friends have an opinio= n about what causes diabetes and how to treat it.   ...and you know what they say about opinions!   Here are three misconceptions about treating diabetes:           Medications will cure type 2 diabetes           You have to slimming           You can't eat any fat or carbs           You have to get expensive herbal medications   ...frankly: you must suffer the side effects of horrendous drugs; starve yo= urself with impossible diets and exhaust yourself in the gym =E2=80=93 till=  you finally wish you had died before the diabetes was discovered. NO; NO; = NO! There is only one cause for type 2 diabetes. One that nobody pays atten= tion to. Tackling this one cause is so easy that my 85 old mother did it (n= o fault mom). It usually takes less than 28 days to completely reverse type=  2 diabetes using this approach.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. = That is why I am making this decision. I'm not afraid of death because I kn= ow where I'm going.

Since the death of my husband; I decided not to remarry again; When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of =C2=A0($11.000.000 Eleven million dollars.) with the Bank. Presently this money is still in bank. And My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to live because my illness has gotten to a very bad stage; Having known my condition I decided to entrust over the deposited fund under your custody to take care of the less-privileged ones therein your country or position; which i believe that you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.     However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and ability to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final wish in implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in your country even before I die here in the hospital; because my present health condition is very critical at the moment everything needs to be process rapidly as soon as possible.   It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in handling the transaction; 5 % percent for any expenses or processing charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones. Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond; if only you are interested for further details of the transaction and execution of this humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful compassionate.     May bless you and your family. Yours sincerely Mrs. Donna McInnes Louise.

It comes from the Latin militaris (from Latin miles; meaning "soldier") through French; but is of uncertain etymology; one suggestion being derived from *mil-it- â€“ going in a body or mass. The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons; or engaged in military service; or in warfare.   As a noun; the military usually refers generally to a country's armed forces; or sometimes; more specifically; to the senior officers who command them. In general; it refers to the physicality of armed forces; their personnel; equipment; and the physical area which they occupy.   As an adjective; military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering; but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general; and anything to do with their profession. The names of both the Royal Military Academy (1741) and United States Military Academy (1802) reflect this. However; at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars; 'military' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole; such as 'military service'; 'military intelligence'; and 'military history'. As such; it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel

Nevertheless; some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. Carolyn Abbate (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at Princeton University. She has been described by the Harvard Gazette as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".   Susan McClary (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "New Musicology" who incorporates feminist music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from Harvard University. One of her best known works is Feminine Endings (1991); which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality; gendered aspects of traditional music theory; gendered sexuality in musical narrative; music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians.

SPAM,      I had this one last brilliant idea. One last tweak on the concept; as we  know symbols become influental in computer system design.   I/T L X; which also would support Science tangenting Islam. No more  hadith/hijabi sects claiming "Islam"; it can be refuted by scientific  understanding of the universe.   Nonsense interpretation and claims of sweaty hijab by force; we support  thyrian lobotomy for.   Really renovating our own religious view; that once was similar  monotheism aswell.   And supporting One Dwea without company; the fundamental monotheistic  principles; very understandable in the indian situation.   I think then I have mananged to shift some money from pop-culture to  science aswell!   So truly; support I/T L X; it is what the time is screaming for.

My name is Mr. Richard Benson a branch bank manager here in Ghana. I have the sum of Sixteen Million; Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars which I would like to transfer into your account and invest in your country if possible into a lucrative business that will be profitable to us.

SPAM,    Hello Dear;   Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know that this letter may come to you as big surprise.  Actually; I came across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my final wish before i die. Meanwhile; I am Mrs. Henrita Pieres; 62 years old; from France; and I am  suffering from a long time cancer and from all indication my condition is really deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously Advised me that I may not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my tumor has reached a  critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical treatment; As a matter of fact; registered nurse by profession while my  husband was dealing on Gold Dust and Gold Dory Bars till his sudden death the year 2016 then I took over his business till date. In fact; at this moment I have a deposit sum of four million five hundred thousand US dollars [$4;500;000.00] with one of the leading bank but unfortunately I cannot visit the bank since I=E2=80=99m critically sick and powerless to do anything myself but my bank account officer advised me to assign any of my trustworthy relative; friends or partner with authorization letter to stand as the recipient of my money but sorrowfully I don=E2=80=99=   have any reliable relative and no child.   Therefore; I want you to receive the money and take 50% to take care of yourself and family while 50% should be use basically  on humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages home; Motherless babies home; less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the world. And as soon as I receive your respond I shall send you the full details with my pictures; banking records and with full contacts of my banking institution to communicate them on the matter.   Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Faithfully; Mrs. Henrita Pieres

A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted; targeted and marked  by the government.   A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted; targeted and marked  by the government.

We will systematically go through a series of steps of totally damaging your reputation. First your database will be leaked or sold to the highest bidder which they will use with whatever their intentions are. Next if there are e-mails found they will be e-mailed that their information has been sold or leaked and your http://www.untroubled.org was at fault thusly damaging your reputation and having angry customers/associates with whatever angry customers/associates do. Lastly any links that you have indexed in the search engines will be de-indexed based off of blackhat techniques that we used in the past to de-index our targets.   How do I stop this?   We are willing to refrain from destroying your site's reputation for a small fee. The current fee is $1500 in bitcoins (BTC).

Please take your time to read this message; although we have never met before; this is no spam; It's a real message sent to you. I know also that you will be amazed at the level of trust that I am willing to place in a person that I have never seen nor spoken with. If I can receive favor from someone I barely know; its not bad entrusting this project to unknown person as long as my spirit directed me to you.   I have been a catholic priest for over 22 years. I spent about 10 years serving at Africa; Burkina Faso to be precise; I spend most time in Ouagadougou Cathedral. Presently; I had a heart surgery on the 23-11-2018 and the Doctors have informed me that I cannot live longer; I had a serious bleeding after the operation. Before I left Ouagadougou to my country for the surgery; a priest friend of mine visited me from Netherlands with three companion; when they went back; one among his companion Transferred 10M$ in my personal account with Bank of Africa and advised that I use the money to help the poor; handicaps and less privileges because he saw the level hardship then.   Because of my present health condition; I cannot live to proceed with the projects; therefore; I have decided to appoint you to reclaim the money which total sum of $10;970;000.00 (Ten million Nine Hundred and seventy Thousand US DOLLARS).   I want you to use this sum to make the world a better place for the poor and less privileged; help the needy and also help your family members.   I took this decision because I was raised in an Orphanage so I don't have relatives and presently; I'm still in the hospital; where I am undergoing treatment. That's why I have decided to contact you so that you can contact my account manager in Bank of Africa; reclaim the money and make good use of it.   then you can contact me through private email addres(RevWrightWatson@yandex.com)   Regards; Rev.Wright Watson

SPAM,    With due respect; I am Mrs. George Olivia; I have decided to donate what I have to you / Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and diagnosed for cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to forgive me and believe he has; because he is a Merciful God I will be going in for an operation surgery soon. I decided to will/donate the sum of ($ 8.1 million DOLLARS) to you for the good work of God Almighty; and also to help the motherless and less privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my relatives (that have squandered the funds gave them for this purpose before) are around me and my health status also. I have adjusted my will and my lawyer is aware.   I wish you all the best and May the good Lord bless you abundantly; and please use the funds judiciously and always extend the good work to others. As soon as you get back to me; I shall give you info on what I need from you; then you will contact the bank and tell them I have willed those properties to you by quoting my personal file routing and account information. And I have also notified the bank that I am willing that properties to you for a good; effective and prudent work. I know I don't know you but I have been directed to do this by God Almighty.   I Have all my Hospital document which i can send to you as prove to what am tell you and my seriousness to this. If you are interested in carrying out this task; get back to me for more details on this noble project of mine.   Yours Faithfully; Mrs. George Olivia

SPAM,      Most of us refuse to believe that another 9/11 event could possibly happen again in the USâ€¦   Especially since we know that the US successfully toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan and killed the Al Qaeda founderâ€¦     Yet THIS undisclosed video reveals a threat that could wipe out 90% of US population in the next couple of months.     In fact; itâ€™s the startling reason why NORAD started moving critical assets back inside Cheyenne Mountain and decided to spend over $700 million to harden the mountain even further.

SPAM,    Dear Friend;   I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before; but need not to worry as I am contacting you independently of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication.   I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11.3million immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.   I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased customer (the account owner) who died a long with his supposed NEXT OF KIN since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 15 years; because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.   By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.   Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.   Best Regards; Mr. Duna Wattara.

SPAM,    Hi dear;   I'm Jessica Vail; from the United States;please i wish to have a communication with you.   I wait for your answer.   Jessica Vail.  
SPAM,    Dear;   My name is Mr Alif Tomar; I am the Bill and Exchange (assistant) Manager of Bank of Africa Ouagadougou; Burkina Faso. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of eighteen million three hundred thousand United State of American dollars (18.3MILLION USA DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died in airline that crashed on 4th October 2001.   Since I got information about his death I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines; but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.   You will be entitled with 40% of the total sum while 60% will be for me after which I will visit your Country to invest my own share when the fund is successfully transferred into your account; Please I would like you to keep this transaction confidential and as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a bank official.   Yours sincerely; Mr Alif Tomar.

SPAM,    Dear sir/madam   My name is Mrs Kadi Hamanin.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you for the execution of the deal described hereunder for our mutual benefit. I Hope you will keep it a secret due to the nature of the transaction. During the course of our audit last month; I discovered an unclaimed/abandoned fund total US$3.5 million in a bank account that belongs to a customer who unfortunately lost his life and entire family in a car accident.   Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for the claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful in locating any of the relatives; now; I sincerely seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at {US$3.5 Million United State Dollars} can be paid to you; which we will share in these percentages ratio; 60% to me and 40% to you. All I request is your utmost sincere co- operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to achieve this project successfully. I have carefully mapped out the moralities for execution of this transaction under a legitimate arrangement to protect you from any breach of the law both in your country and here in my country when the fund is being transferred to your bank account.   I will have to provide the entire relevant document that will be requested to indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this legacy and our bank will release the fund to you without any further delay; upon your consideration and acceptance of this offer; please send me the following information as stated below so we can proceed and get this fund transferred to your designated bank account immediately. I know much about the existence of this fund and the secrets surrounding this money.

SPAM,    Greetings From Mrs. Sarah Koffi   I'm contacting you based on your good profiles I read and for a good reasons; I am in search of a property to buy in your country as I intended to come over to your country for investment; Though I have not meet with you before but I believe that one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life.   My name is Mrs. Sarah Koffi. My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal Government of Sudan and he has a personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone town and Upper Nile city. What I have experience physically; I don't wish to experience it again in my life due to the recent civil Ethnic war cause by our President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar; I have been Under United Nation refuge camp in chad to save my life and that of my little daughter.   Though; I do not know how you will feel to my proposal; but the truth is that I sneaked into Chad our neighboring country where I am living now as a refugee. I escaped with my little daughter when the rebels bust into our house and killed my husband as one of the big oil dealers in the country; ever since then; I have being on the run.   I left my country and move to Chad our neighboring country with the little ceasefire we had; due to the face to face peace meeting accord coordinated by the US Secretary of State; Mr John Kerry and United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) between our President Mr Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar to stop this war.   I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to invest the $8 million dollars deposited by my late husband in Bank because my life is no longer safe in our country; since the rebels are looking for the families of all the oil business men in the country to kill; saying that they are they one that is milking the country dry.   I will offer you 20% of the total fund for your help while I will partner with you for the investment in your country. If I get your reply.   I will wait to hear from you so as to give you details.With love from    i need you to contact me here sarahkoffi389@yahoo.co.jp   Mrs. Sarah Koffi

SPAM,    Dear Good Friend     I am Dr.Ken Obiorah; a Chatered accountant by profession working with the Federal  Ministry Of Agriculture in Nigeria. Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail; but I can assure you that at the end; we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture; F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$52;750;000.00.which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart; I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As Civil servants; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$52;750;000.00 million); 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction; we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.   We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you; indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.     Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated.

SPAM,     Mrs.Monica fernandez   ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.   I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr SAZON FERNANDEZ who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2015.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 20Million Dollars  (twenty Million United State Dollars) with one finance/ security in Europe . Presently;  this money is still with the Security Company. Recently; my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this Fund to church or better still a Christian individual  that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use  this fund to fund churches; orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone  communication in this regard because of my health and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Europe .  I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this Funds. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard.

SPAM,    Dear Good Friend     I am Dr.Ken Obiorah; a Chatered accountant by profession working with the Federal  Ministry Of Agriculture in Nigeria. Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail; but I can assure you that at the end; we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture; F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$52;750;000.00.which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart; I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As Civil servants; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$52;750;000.00 million); 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction; we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.   We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you; indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.     Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated.   Yours faithfully;   Dr.Ken Obiorah. Private E-mail:drkenobiorah3@yahoo.com Cellphone: +234-81-0920-6368

SPAM,    Hello; I work as a private investigator. Our company received an order to hack into your email; phone; cloud; = network and to collect intelligence.

You will also have a report on yourself (including a list of compromised = accounts; devices and photos). Usually; it's not the case; but after reviewing this matter; I see that = something illegal is planned against you. Material we have can easily be used to blackmail you. We usually work on private and corporate espionage cases; but this one = is different. We have received a 50% prepayment for your case from that person (total = agreed upon cost was 12500 USD). However; I will make a discount to you (without any profit for the = agency); if you decide to buy this information. Do not try to email me back. This is a throwaway address. I have to = protect identity; because nature of this job is already illegal. When you send the payment; I will get back to you. You have 2 business = days to make the transfer. It will cost you 40% of the remaining = balance. We will process &#36;2;500 payment through bitcoin. In case you have = trouble with bitcoin; google how to fund it. Send BTC to this wallet 1AxJV1VYBccQvK44unpAx1KAbzvWmEQWDc   I strongly recommend you to make this decision alone for now; without = consulting law enforcement or anybody else. It will be up to you what to do after you get the information. We will = delete all files. The original customer will get nothing. Please keep in mind; because I need to pay Chinese contractors; and if = you decline this offer; I will have to go to the original customer and = send them all intel to cover the costs. But at least you know that now and have a free heads up of what's = coming.

SPAM,    bruce@untroubled.org;       Did you hear about the Florida man who recently cracked the lotto code and shocked the World? His name is Richard Lustig and he is defying all odds.       The lottery office started to look at him very strangely as he made the trip to see them just about every other week. I think half of them were smiling; and the other half worried; but they couldnt do anything about itthey knew just like you do that its impossible to cheat the lottoand he wasnt doing anything dishonest or immoral       He just developed an easy method to crack the lotto code; that worked extraordinarily well       It has turned him into the only 7-Time Lottery Game Grand Prize Winner in the World       Go Here to See the Same Method He Used to Win 7 Times and Crack The Lotto Code (access expires today) <http://www.deathminor.icu/hoooflaogpv/pescl748941uakkwjkjn/LVTK21XLrpWsICOoo16tjIzM9inRZCujizl-PSkdCxo/u-hxikZfxU2DAY5ezYHcUfrhSVQUewt02HiuXdKVdR7WRJ3Un69gWGwoIpi-ZCkMd2swl83n39iKi_L8LkHhrFl8csxEbSrNb6uMeeqNo34>

SPAM,    Dear Good Friend     I am Dr.Ken Obiorah; a Chatered accountant by profession working with the Federal  Ministry Of Agriculture in Nigeria. Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail; but I can assure you that at the end; we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture; F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$52;750;000.00.which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart; I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As Civil servants; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$52;750;000.00 million); 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction; we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.   We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you; indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.     Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated.   Yours faithfully;   Dr.Ken Obiorah. Private E-mail:drkenobiorah3@yahoo.com Cellphone: +234-81-0920-6368

SPAM,    Do THIS 1 hour before bed to pee out stubborn fat in the morning:   Recent studies are now showing how a simple tweak to your bedtime ritual can have dramatic effects in shrinking fat tissue while reversing the signs of premature biological aging every time you fall asleep.    In fact; Lisa used this 2-minute daily hack to finally rid herself of 62 lbs of baby weight; which not only resulted in a reversal of Type 2 Diabetes; but also forced her to buy a whole new wardrobe! And her brother John used this same daily ritual to drop 54 lbs of stubborn abdominal fat that had been making him miserable for years; all while sleeping much deeper too. . .    >> Here's how (no plastic surgery needed) http://www.hellfireeven.xyz/bootable-Mankowski/80a4j2395N8L6k10Rd60NJ287Y21bFv4GIf4rxvs4FhIHEsvZ6cdTSmm5R1WI06X@lUHD         Footer http://www.hellfireeven.xyz/9354N2395zS8aT12bOnsd61z287j21zFv4GIf4rxvs4FhIHEsvZ6wdTSmm6vDy1y05GUXHD/dyad-Durward

Untilâ€¦   She stumbled on this strange â€œcarb trickâ€ and burned away an unheard of 22lbs pounds in just 13 daysâ€¦   And because of this one simple shift in her eating; she did it without starving herselfâ€¦!   â€¦ and without a lick of exercise!   Now get this... with the same carb trick she dropped a total of 37lbs in the FIRST month!   â€¦ and shocked her doctor by completely reversing ANY pre diabetic symptoms!   You wonâ€™t even believe her final result so I wonâ€™t bother telling you. However you can see it for yourself on this page...   This might work for men; however itâ€™s only been proven for women...

I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless b= abies/Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God be= cause I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have de= cided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for = the good work of Almighty God; I will be going in for an operation surgery = soon.   Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity pu= rposes. Because of this money remains unclaimed after my death; the bank ex= ecutives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe = use it for selfishness and worthless ventures; I need a very honest person = who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; wido= ws and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be name= d after my late husband and my name.   I need your urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this proje= ct; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferre= d to your bank account or online banking.   Thanks Mrs. Mina A. Brunel

SPAM,      Hello. My name is Panda Paul Magnus. I am a music producer; singer;  front-end developer and part time writer. Having become unemployed due  to COVID19; I spent my time writing a book (manuscript on:  https://gogetfunding.com/7-and-the-11-heavens-book-publishing/).   It has turned out to be very good with my editor saying it wasÂ  "the  best piece she has read in decades."   Consequently; I have been offered a publishing contract for my book "7  and the 11 heavens". However; because I am a first time author; the  publishers want me to demonstrate that I can generate the required sales  before they can risk the investment.   They want me to get pre-orders of no less than 500 copies; but the more  the better. I am sending this email to ask for help in pre-ordering the  book; or making a donation toward the production cost of the book; to  enable me take advantage of this once in a life time opportunity. Copies  of the book will be sent to everyone who pre-orders as soon as it is  ready in; give or take; 60 days. A full manuscript can also be emailed  upon request in the meantime.   My GoGetFunding campaign for the book is on:  https://gogetfunding.com/7-and-the-11-heavens-book-publishing/   I would truly appreciate any support I can get. Thank you for your time;  and support in advance.

SPAM,        Dear Friend;   I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before; but need not to worry as I am contacting you independently of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11.3million immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.   I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased customer (the account owner) who died a long with his supposed Next Of Kin since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 15 years; because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.   By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.   Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.   Best Regards; Ahmed Ouedraogo.

SPAM,    Hi!    Unfortunately; I have some bad news for you. Several months ago; I got access to the device you are using to browse the internet. Since that time; I have been monitoring your internet activity.    Being a regular visitor of adult websites; I can confirm that it is you who is responsible for this.  To keep it simple; the websites you visited provided me with access to your data.    I've uploaded a Trojan horse on the driver basis that updates its signature several times per day; to make it impossible for antivirus to detect it. Additionally; it gives me access to your camera and microphone. Moreover; I have backed-up all the data; including photos; social media; chats and contacts.    Just recently; I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen; while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!    Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks; and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.    With that in mind; here is my proposal:  Transfer the amount equivalent to 1500 USD to my Bitcoin wallet; and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.    In my opinion; this is a somewhat modest price for my work.  You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing; seeing that it's not very difficult.   My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 16EuKQaCEEeba1Us68P9RwKjc8HTT4zWRR   You have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:    It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically. It makes no sense to complain either; since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.  Everything has been orchestrated precisely.    If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared; and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that; the video will be posted on the web!   P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).   Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck; next time please be careful.

My people have kilos of gold that they want to sell and are looking for serious buyers.  Their major problem is finding serious buyer.

SPAM,    Attention please!   I am the Chief Financial Officer of Rockhopper and Gas company London UK; and by the virtue; as the Chief Financial Officer. I got your contact through a directory search and decided to propose this business. I am seeking your assistance in remitting of some funds;  Ninety five million  to your account for private investment purpose; hence my request for your assistance.      SOURCE OF THE FUND:   The fund to be transferred into your account is accrued from an over-invoiced contract amount awarded for the completion of the last phase of our refinery; valves and depot for storage of product all over our branches here in the UK which include laying of  distribution pipelines. The contract which was originally valued for One Hundred and Twenty Seven Million was manipulated to read; Two Hundred and Twenty Two Million.  The extra; Ninety Five Million; is what I want to move to your account; the original contractors who executed the job has been paid all their contract bills remaining this Ninety Five Million.    DISBURSEMENT:   I have resolved that you take Forty percent  of the total amount for your assistance. that is; fronting you as a sub contractor to claim the remaining balance of Ninety Five Million  which is left now in our bank from the over invoice contract because it is impossible for me to claim the over invoiced amount without your assistance as a Foreign Contractor. In addition Ten percent has been mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses that   might be incurred by both of us during this business while Fifty percent  will be my own share.   SECURITY:   All modalities to effect the payment and subsequent transfer of this money has been worked out; so this transaction is Hundred percent risk free; though you are required to treat it with strictest confidence; on our acceptance please send to me your personal details and your direct mobile phone number for speedy correspondence.   I am looking forward to doing business with you. Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. Do kindly furnish me with your contact details if you are interested in partnering with me on this transaction.     Yours Faithfully;   Stewart MacDonald Chief Financial Officer Rockhopper Exploration PLC

SPAM,     Dear Friend;     I am glad to know you; but God knows you better and he knows why he has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be surprised at all. My name is Mrs. Donna Louise McInnes; a widow; i have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease. At this moment i am about to end the race like this because the illness has gotten to a very bad stage; without any family members and no child. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to entrust to you for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of ($11.000.000 Eleven million dollars.) deposited in the Bank.  Having known my present health status; I decided to entrust this fund to you believing that you will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein.   Therefore I need you to assist me and reclaim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages and giving justice and help to the poor; needy and to promote the words of God and the effort that the house of God will be maintained says The Lord." Jeremiah 22:15-16.=E2=80=9C   It will be my great pleasure to compensate you with 35 % percent of the total money for your personal use; 5 % percent for any expenses that may occur during the international transfer process while 60% of the money will go to the charity project.   All I require from you is sincerity and the ability to complete God's task without any failure. It will be my pleasure to see that the bank has finally released and transferred the fund into your bank account therein your country even before I die here in the hospital; because of my present health status everything needs to be processed rapidly as soon as possible. I am waiting for your immediate reply; if only you are interested for further details of the transaction and execution of this charitable project.   Best Regards your friend Mrs. Donna Louise McInnes.

SPAM,    Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Federal capital territory Office. complex block A;area 11 P.M.B.135 Garki  Abuja.Fct   Good Day     I am Dr.Ken Obiorah; a Chartered accountant by profession working with the Federal  Ministry Of Agriculture in Nigeria. Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail; but I can assure you that at the end; we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture; F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$52;750;000.00.which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart; I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As Civil servants; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$52;750;000.00 million); 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction; we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.   We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you; indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.     Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated.   Yours faithfully;   Dr.Ken Obiorah Bsc. Chartered accountant Private E-mail:drkenobiora3@yahoo.com  Cellphone: +234-81-0920-6368

SPAM,    I presumed you had a nice weekend.   My name is Reem Hashimy; the Emirates Minister of State and Managing Director of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 Committee which has been postponed to October 2021 to March 2022 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.   I am writing to you to manage the funds I received as financial gratification from various foreign companies I assisted to receive a participation approval to the coming event. The amount is $44;762;906.00 United States dollars. But I can not personally manage the fund in my country because of the sensitive nature of my office and the certain restriction on married Muslim women.   For this reason; an agreement was reached with a consulting firm to direct the various financial gifts into an open beneficiary account in my name with a bank where it will be possible for me to instruct the transfer of ownership right to a third party for investment purpose; which is the reason I am contacting you to receive the fund and manage it as my investment partner. Note that the fund is NOT connected to any criminal or terrorist activity.   On your indication of interest with your information to include your name; your phone number and contact mailing address; I will instruct the consulting firm to process the fund from the bank to your country for investment purposes.   Regards. Reem Hashimy.

SPAM,    Greetings My Dear;       I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night   without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen; a widow suffering from   long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (eleven milliondollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious   sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works;   for orphanages; widows and also  build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and   the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where   I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to   know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting   for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen

I am writing to you to manage the funds I received as financial gratification from various foreign companies I assisted to receive a participation approval to the coming event. The amount is $44;762;906.00 United States dollars. But I can not personally manage the fund in my country because of the sensitive nature of my office and the certain restriction on married Muslim women.   For this reason; an agreement was reached with a consulting firm to direct the various financial gifts into an open beneficiary account in my name with a bank where it will be possible for me to instruct the transfer of ownership right to a third party for investment purpose; which is the reason I am contacting you to receive the fund and manage it as my investment partner. Note that the fund is NOT connected to any criminal or terrorist activity.   On your indication of interest with your information to include your name; your phone number and contact mailing address; I will instruct the consulting firm to process the fund from the bank to your country for investment purposes.

SPAM,    I'AM SUFFERING FROM CANCER OF THE HEART   Dear Friend.   Greetings to you in the name of the Lord God Almighty am MRS. NICOLE MAROIS From (Paris) France; but am based in Burkina Faso Africa for eight years now as a business woman dealing on gold exportation and cotton Sales. But I have been suffering from this deadly disease called cancer for long and the doctor just said I have just few weeks to live. I know it will be difficult for you to believe my story now; but this is the situation I found myself in; it=E2=80=99s not my desire to =   on a sick bed today but God knows best;   Now that I am about to end the race like this; without any family Members and no child. I have $5.8 Million US DOLLARS in BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) Burkina Faso it=E2=80=99s all my life savings; I instructed the Ban=   to give it to St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest because i do not trust them; I am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick bed.   I will instruct the bank to transfer this fund to you as a foreigner but you have to promise me that you will take 40 Percent(%) of the total money for your personal use While 60 Percent (%) of the money will go to charity; Orphanage and less Privileges" people in the street and helping the Needy. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member; just to Endeavour that the house of God is maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because this sickness has suffered me so much.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank and I will also instruct my Bank Manager to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.   I look forward to getting a reply from you.   Thanks and God bless you;   Mrs NICOLE MAROIS.

SPAM,    Attention:                     I know that this letter will be a surprising one to you....           Firstly; I will like to introduce myself formally as MR.JAMES MARK           ;The bank president of The BRITISH ROYAL BANK           You are been officially contacted by me because your Inheritance           Funds were Re-deposited into the Suspense Account" of           British Royal Bank last week; because you did not Claim your           funds as the Rightful beneficiary in our bank.           This morning at about (9:00am Standard Pacific           Time); I was alerted by my Secretary that Three men were at my           Office Reception waiting to see me and so I told my Secretary to           let them in.I had to ask them why they came to see me in person           and they said that they were here to Collect the Inheritance Bill           Sum of One Hundred Million Dollars(US100;000;000:00) which rightfully           belongs to you; on your behalf.             These foreigners actually claimed           this beyond reasonable doubts. At this development I asked them           who authorized them to come down to London for the           Collection of this Payment and they told me that you asked them           to come and collect this Funds on your Behalf.           Infact this was the biggest shock that this Bank have ever           received so far because your Inheritance Funds is still in the           British Suspense Account of British Royal Bank; yet you sent these men           to come and collect this Funds on your behalf without notifying us.             We in this Bank do not understand why you sent these men to come           and Collect your Funds on your behalf.Kindly clarify us on this           issue before we make this Payment to these foreigners whom came on           your behalf.

SPAM,      Good day. Please forgive me for using this means to reach you but I can't think of any other way of letting you know the urgent matter at hand. A national of your country who happens to be a customer of our bank where I work (Ecobank Ghana) was a victim of an auto crash in 2017 and he left behind a huge sum of money with interest totaling $10.5 Million; in a dormant account. As his account manager; I have been mandated to provide his next of kin if there is or the estate will then revert to the government treasury as an unclaimed bill. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating his fund valued at $10.5 Million dollars in our Bank. Ecobank is one of the commercial banks licensed by the Bank of Ghana. I will furnish you with more details as soon as I receive your positive response. No risk involved at all. Yours faithfully; Mr. Ray Daniels.

SPAM,    Hello Friend;   My name is Reem E. Al-Hashimi; the Emirates Minister of State and Managing Director of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 Committee. I am writing to you to stand as my partner to receive my share of gratification from foreign companies whom I helped during the bidding exercise towards the Dubai World Expo 2020 Committee and also I want to use this fund to assist Coronavirus Symptoms and Causes.   I am a single Arab woman and serving as a minister; and there is a limit to my personal income and investment level. For this reason; I cannot receive such a huge sum back to my country or my personal account; so an agreement was reached with the foreign companies to direct the gratifications to an open beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possible for me to instruct further transferrals of the fund to a third party account for investment purposes which is the reason I contacted you to receive the fund as my partner for investment in your country.   The amount is valued at 47;745;533 Euros with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transferral to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund; I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.   If you can handle the fund in a good investment; reply to this email only: reem2018@daum.net   Best Regards; Ms. Reem  
SPAM,    Dear Friend. I have a business proposal of  $35 Million USD which i want to transact with you  get back for more details.Best Regards From Salah Ibrahim  
SPAM,    I am Mr.Richard; I am a banker by profession; i need your urgent assistance; from my section in the bank i discovered an abandoned sum of $11.6million dollars that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his supposed next of kin since July 22; 2003. The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it. I need your co-operation in transferring the fund into your private bank account.

SPAM,    Dear Good Friend     I am Dr.Ken Obiorah; a Chartered accountant by profession working with the Federal  Ministry Of Agriculture in Nigeria. Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail; but I can assure you that at the end; we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture; F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$52;750;000.00.which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart; I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As Civil servants; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$52;750;000.00 million); 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction; we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.   We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you; indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.     Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated.   Yours faithfully;   Dr.Ken Obiorah. Chartered accountant Private E-mail:drkenobiorah@citromail.hu     Cellphone: +234-81-0920-6368

Although their spread can have beneficial aspects; invasive species adversely affect the invaded habitats and bioregions; causing ecological; environmental; and/or economic damage. Sometimes the term is used for native species that invade human habitats and become invasive pests. In the 21st century they have become a serious economic; social; and environmental threat.   Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms is a natural phenomenon; but human-facilitated introductions have greatly increased the rate; scale; and geographic range of invasion. For millennia; humans have served as both accidental and deliberate dispersal agents; beginning with our earliest migrations; accelerating in the age of discovery; and accelerating again with international trade. Notable examples of invasive plant species include the kudzu vine; Andean pampas grass; English ivy; Japanese knotweed; and yellow starthistle. Animal examples include the New Zealand mud snail; feral pig; European rabbit; grey squirrel; domestic cat; carp; and ferret. Some popular reference sources now name Homo sapiens; especially modern-age humans; as an invasive species; but broad appreciation of human learning capacity and our behavioral potential and plasticity argues against any such fixed categoriz

The sealed envelope according to section 229 subsection 31 of the International Commerce Regulators Code Enforcement Guidelines; lacks PROOF OF OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATE AND LEGAL DELIVERY PERMIT CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE and since the content is valued financial material of such amount from the joint team of the Federal Bureau Of Investigation and Homeland Security; you're to reply for direction on how to procure the envelope and be relieved of the charge of tax evasion which is a jail-able offense under section 12 subsection 441 of the tax code.

SPAM,    Dear Friend; With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose I wish to write to you today; seeking for your urgent assistance in this humanitarian investment project to be established in your country for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. My names are Mrs.Alary Jean Claude; a dying widow hospitalized undergoing treatment for brain tumor disease; I hope that you will not expose or betray this belief and confidence that I am about to delegate to you for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. My late husband made a substantial deposit with the Bank which I have Strong-Willed to hand over and entrust the sum of ($ 12;000.000;Dollar) in the account under your guardianship for you to invest it into any social charitable project in your country. Based on my present health status I am permanently indisposed to handle finances or any financial related project.   With this intention; I am determined to contact you in order to sustain and assist me as my rightful beneficiary and claim the money for humanitarian purposes for the mutual benefits of the less privileged ones. Because If the fund remains unclaimed with the bank I pass away; those gluttonous bank executives will place the fund as an unclaimed Fund and share it among themselves for their selfish and worthless ventures. In this regard; I will be grateful for your kind acceptance to carry out this transaction and fulfill my final wish in implementing the charitable project in your country as it requires absolute trust and devotion without any failure. Meanwhile It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment Manager/Partner with 40% percent of the total amount as commission/share just for you to take this charitable project serious and handle it with sincerity of mind; showing honesty and attention in our communication and in every aspect of this project; While 60% of the money will be invested into the charity project.   Thank you very much for your kind consideration and I will be happy to receive your prompt response for further correspondence. May the peace of God be with you. Yours beloved Sister in Christ Mrs.Alary Jean Claude.

I contacted you because you bear the surname identity and therefore can present you as the beneficiary to inherit the account proceeds of the deceased since there is no written "WILL" or trace to the deceased family relatives. My aim is to present you to my Bank Authorities as the Next of Kin to our deceased client. I will guide you all through the Claim procedure by providing all relevant Information and guiding you in your decisions and response to the Bank Management. All the papers will be processed after your acceptance.

SPAM,    Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Federal capital territory Office. complex block A;area 11 P.M.B.135 Garki  Abuja.Fct   Dear Friend     It is with trust and confidence that i write to make this urgent business proposal to you. I was assigned by two of my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$52;750;000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.   This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry; the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$52.750 million; which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As government officials; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$52;750;000.00 million)15% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account  while 85% will be reserved for us.   We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.   Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before  you.

Note: our president Muhammadu Buhari collaborated with Ibrahim Magu as the new EFCC chairman; Economic Financial Crime Commission; Mr.Ibrahim Magu  to stop the junior ranks officers from transferring funds out  of the country. He sent different Cublication to many countries in the world as propaganda to discourage all government Officials from transferring funds into an overseas account to avoid and save guides the countries economy.   Apparently; so that other government officials will not benefits from these( oil windfalls venture) where he has been a culprit alone with his aides. More details about this transaction will be given to you as soon as we receive your positive respond.   Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you; your urgent response will be appreciated. In addition; there are some faceless beings in my country that are making use of top government official names to swindle money from innocent citizens and that includes my name. You can confirm by searching the name of our Central Bank of Nigeria Governor; you will see that his name is part of the scam list meanwhile we are innocent officials completely unaware of the situation happening.

Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills; twenties; fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.   "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"; says the 41-year-old woman; "There was over $71;000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year".   The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.   As it turns out; the boy had been sending out; via E-mail; a type of  "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months; he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.   "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck; I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"; says the clever 15-year-old.   The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list; then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down ; and finally to add your name to the top of the list.   The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time; and really did not think it was going to work"; the boy continues.   Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail; the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines; but envelopes containing $5 bills.   "About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on; "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".  Over the next few weeks; the boy continued sending out the E-mail."  The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet; barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties;  fifties and hundreds.   "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it; but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."  Surprisingly; the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting news    team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact; it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws; Title 18; Section 1302 and 1341; or Title 18; Section 3005 in the US code; also in the code of federal regulations; Volume 16; Sections 255 and 436; which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.   Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read; "Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.   [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71;000 - please continue reading. What  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say "Bull"; please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the  Internet; a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below; to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions; they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".     DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED; IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.     Note* follow the directons below; I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.   In order for all of us to be successful; many; many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the following company. They send out the offers; and all I do is accept money for reports; then I send back to the people as soon as possible.   This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was  approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment; I received total $610;470.00 in 21 weeks; with money still coming in".   Pam Hedland; Fort Lee; New Jersey.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time  but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290;000.00. So far; in the past 8 months by re-entering the program; I have made over $710;000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything." More testimonials later but first;   PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE   ++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++ For each report; send $5 CASH; THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE  REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet; the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally; where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:     METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     Let's say that you decide to start small; just to see how it goes; and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5;000e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5;000 each). Continuing with this example; you send out only 5;000 e-mails.     With a 0.2% response; that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5;000 e-mail each for a total of 50;000. Out of those 50;000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.   Those 100 people mail out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 500;000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.   Those 1000 people send out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10;000 orders for Report #4.   Those 10;000 people send out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 50;000;000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100;000 orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100;000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500;000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5;000 + 4..... $50;000 + 5..... $500;000....... Grand Total=$555;550.00     NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT; YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REMEMBER FRIEND; THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5;000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100;000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on  the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me; many people will do just that; and more!     METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response.     We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive; all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it; will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.   =ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper; Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering; YOUR E-MAIL  ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!   ++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++ "My name is Mitchell. My wife; Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving  "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing; spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her; and was ready to lay the old  "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well; the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147;200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby".   Mitchell Wolf; Chicago; Illinois   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ "Not being the gambling type; it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am; I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back". "I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319;210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big".   Dan Sondstrom; Alberta; Canada   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ "I had received this program before. I deleted it; but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course; I had no idea who to contact to get another copy; so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490;000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks".

SPAM,    Dear sir;;     My name is DR Steven M Duba ; the son of MR. Theo Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South African Information exchange Johannesburg.     Due to the previous war against white farmers in Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country; he ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country;my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt MUGABE. The president’s supporters invaded my father’s farm; burnt everything in the farm; arrested him and confiscated all his investment.   Early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president Mugabe started; my late father envisaged a worse situation; he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa. When he arrived South Africa; he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company; then; went back home. He registered the box as family treasure.   While he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture; he directed me to his lawyer in South Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He was arrested on the 5th of March last year. Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of December 2001.I came to south Africa March;2002.   Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and depressing because my father’s lawyer is presently hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem; though the lodgment documents are with me; as such I want to relocate to your country for good. Presently; my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum permit as a refugee.   I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of this country to your country for investment. If you think you can help me; Please try to get in touch with me immediately with the  number below . Your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my country is still lingering; please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret; because I wouldn’t want anything that will expose me; and the existence of this money.   Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.   Sincerely yours;   STEVEN DUBA (DR).   TEL:27-83-713-2696                     __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

SPAM,    It was the Spring of 1979.     I was just a tall; goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the cafeteria; I walked from table to table ...   Stealing other kids' lunch money.   No; I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today;" I said; "and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment was too good to pass up; and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course  when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash; I promised to pay them even more the week after that; if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.   Eventually the end of the year came and went; high school started and with it came girls; and homework; and parties; and sports; and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.   I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid; and I didn't even get beat up.   Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.   First of all; greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week; so cash out when you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.   Second; never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money; not yours.   The "professionals"; those stuffy investment counselors and money managers; will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to those guys; the longer you keep your money in the market; the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "NEVER".     In a sense; they are right.  If you put $250;000 in an index fund right now; you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:   Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?   Hell no!   You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years; what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?     The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.   If your goal is to make quick profits in the market; volatility is your ally; and stability your enemy.  You want to see those large upswings; two hundred points in a day; followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the  money.   What I'm talking about here is day trading.     My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.    The day trader buys or sells 5;000 shares of XYZ for a $25;000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly; taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock; and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours; sometimes within minutes.     I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science; and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.   Society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.     The truth is; wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.     Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.   They make their money only if you believe two lies:   1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.   2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.   Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely; positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...   The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.     After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade; and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market; I've learned the following lessons:   ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.   ** Anyone can do it.   ** It only takes a few hours to learn.   When I discovered the secret to day trading; I didn't become wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash; drive to Wal-mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun; and rob your local bank. The  only way to get rich; quick or otherwise; is through hard work; knowledge; and determination.   After learning the fundamentals of day trading; I started  practicing the trading art itself; and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living; and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no  formal financial training; minimal effort and only moderate risk; I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained  during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book; the Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes; and from my successes; as I teach you the simple; secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year.   The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands; even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.

SPAM,    My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason; the houses just don't sell.   I need those houses...   Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However; the private investors I work with use "unconventional" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900;000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.)    I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm; which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time; and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.    If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties; please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com    Best Wishes;  Jeremy Lessaris     847.366.4300 www.synteligent.com jeremy@synteligent.com     To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message

SPAM,    OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX IKOYI-LAGOS.   ATTN:;                     First; I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue of it’s nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.   We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing;(FMW&H); Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency; making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration.    In the course of our work on the CRP; we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.   I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service; hence the need for an overseas partner.   We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction. (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)   All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names; company's name; address;details & activities; telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.   Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me.    Yours faithfully;   Egnr. Femi Daniel.

SPAM,        I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.   I'm ambitious; but extremely lazy; and I make over  $250;000 a year.  Are you curious yet?   In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret; it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...   You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online; but you thought they  were the big corporate execs; famous programmers; or boy-geniuses.   Well; grasshopper; think again ...   It's people like you and me that are making the real money.  Yep; people like YOU AND ME!   Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999; small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500  companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.   Today small business owners and ordinary folks  like you and me can use the web to achieve complete  financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little  work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing  technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.   If you've ever recieved an email advertisement; then  you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on  DELETE fast enough for most of those ads; right? You might not want their product; but remember that  thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a  percentage game - every bulker who contacts you  makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I  guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and  review some numbers ...   If you sell on eBay; you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days.  Using bulk email; YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100;000 emails or 100 million emails; the price is the same. ZERO!   Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad!   Imagine that you have a decent product with a  profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send  an email ad to 500;000 people; and only one person  in a thousand actually places an order; then you just  generated 500 orders and made $10;000 in a few hours  of work.     It's that simple ...   All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.   The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't  matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student  using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old  executive working from an office building in New  York City.  Anyone; and I repeat ANYONE; can start  bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All  it takes is a  few days of study; plenty of ambition;  and some basic familiarity with the Internet.   I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the  "Dot Com" mania; and I've never looked back.  I  started with no money; no product to sell; and only  the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an  opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later;  I bought my own home - with CASH.     You don't need any money.  You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.     If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!   I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of them; then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100;000 using bulk email this year.   Here goes ...   Do you have basic experience with the web?  Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time?   Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards  complete financial freedom?     If you answer YES to these questions; you could be making $5;000 - $20;000 per week working from your  home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats  the 9-5 daily grind!   All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work to make big bucks; but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do      You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.   Don't worry; it's not! I will show you step-by-step  how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business.  You'll be generating  orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

After reading the Bulkbook; you can build your complete  product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE  not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within  seven days. In fact ...

SPAM,    Dear Sir;  With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you would be of great assistance to my children and I. I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed that you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to intimidate me or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the KEREMA local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR. MUNDI A. KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated; he  instructed me and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately; before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG) forces intervened; which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children and I managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came into Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited with a Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the currier company who will freight the money to your country. Meanwhile; I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in your country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the future of my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the Trust Company in any of their branches in Europe; after which the fund will be deposited into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account. We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I am being monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents; I will advice you to have the  deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this email: ibrahimkojo@caramail.com ; immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring same into your account. Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private discussions.  Note: There is no risk involved in this business.  Remain Blessed;  MRS. ANNE  KOJO                                    
SPAM,    Dear Sir/Madam;   I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties; ie (me and you) I am also believing that you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect.   Well; I am  VICTOR SANKOH; Son to Mr.FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father; he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately; with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two Million dollars).   This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family before his arrest.   Thereafter; I rushed down to Abidjan with these documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father. Also; I have been granted political stay as a Refugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.   Meanwhile; my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment . Based on this ; I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account; but I will demand for the following requirement:   (1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another neaarby country where taxation will not takegreat toll on the money?   (2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me come over to meet you in your country for theinvestment of this money?   (3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund willbe invested?   Please; all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please; want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you.   For your assistance in this transaction; I have decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such; I would like you to keep this business very confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply. Thank you and God bless you.

Coupled with the  false emails I received myself; it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the  only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

However; the additional  information won't be required.   The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads; as  campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the  same time; opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous  political spam.   Target Wireless; a small New Jersey-based wireless media company; had  asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter; saying that requiring  financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would  use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.   Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from  the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was  supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee; the Cellular  Telecommunications and Internet Association; and some advertising trade  groups.   FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the  commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the  potential to reach more voters.   "We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work;" he said.   Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous.   Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.   Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as  "good for America."   "It will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office;" he said. "We have free speech on our side."

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed; you could always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

"Their      single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true      parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover; the economy will have to be      retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of      the federal budget goes to arms; and taxes are paid almost exclusively by      the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and      poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have      a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will      require many years."              Welcome news.

HAM,    >>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk    Tuesday; 8 October; 2002; 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK     Fake bank website cons victims    West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online  service to milk victims of cash; say police. The fake site was used to squeeze  more money out of people they had already hooked.     The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service;  (NCIS); said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100;000 after being  taken in by the fake website.     The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a  share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African  nations.     NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would  otherwise spot the scam.     Convincing site     News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an  unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out  their victims.     A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in  front of the bank's name.     "I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated;" said the NCIS  spokesman. "It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced  online."     Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However; the people  behind it have not been caught.     NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100;000.     The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many  other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.     Domain games     Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or  419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any  cash successfully moved out of Africa.     The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such  crimes.     Like any con; there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking  the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe  uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash.     Although this con has been practiced for years; people still fall victim to  it.     NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in  London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con.     Cutting edge fraud     Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of  legitimacy.       People tricked into clicking on fake sites    But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in  place of the certificates.     "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web  technology;" said the spokesman.     One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website  that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African  Reserve Bank; the country's national bank.     Typically; victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to  visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has  been deposited in their name.     But before they can get their hands on the cash; the victims are typically  asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead.     Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national  priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it.     Modern gloss     An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that  criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give  old cons a modern gloss.     The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come  forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two  months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud.     He said any e-mail; fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be  true; undoubtedly is.     One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment  service Paypal.     Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account  and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information.     The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed  people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.     
HAM,    Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work    Tuesday October 8; 2002 12:00 PM STOCKHOLM; Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders. Riccardo Giacconi; 71; of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington; D.C.; will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering contributions to astrophysics; which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources.'' Raymond Davis; Jr.; 87; of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba; 76; of the University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos; elusive particles that stream from the sun by the billion. Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine. In fact; Davis' early experiments; performed during the 1960s in a South Dakota gold mine; confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion. Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work; and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions; some of the brightest objects in the universe. The Italian-born Giacconi; a U.S. citizen; was awarded half of the prize for building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and sharp - images of the universe;'' the academy said. His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy; which has led to the discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born. When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside Washington; he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba also was phoned at home in Tokyo; but the academy was still trying to reach Davis; spokesman Erling Norrby said. This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney Brenner; 75; and Sir John E. Sulston; 60; and American H. Robert Horvitz; 55; as winners of the medicine prize; selected by a committee at the Karolinska Institute. The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how viruses and bacteria invade human cells; including in conditions such as AIDS; strokes; cancer and heart attacks. The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel later the same day. The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday; the Swedish Academy said on Tuesday. The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden - will be announced Friday in Oslo; Norway. The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are not publicly revealed for 50 years. Alfred Nobel; the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees. In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and ``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics.'' The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; which also chooses the chemistry and economics winners; invited nominations from previous recipients and experts in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted in strict secrecy. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10; the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896; in Stockholm and in Oslo.

HAM,    http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722   Pro-hunt activists target top sight   ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate. Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the night. In another incident; the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure; which is thought to represent a Celtic god or tribal symbol. Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radical alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images. The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in 1857. But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse Association; who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet. John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets. "It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards; which will help turn the white horse grey. It will not get another refit for another year. "Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or a lorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off." The sculpture needs constant work because; unlike chalk horses in the south of England; it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening. Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration; which means it will need more work next time. "We would have more sympathy if; having made the point; they would come to take it away again because it was a major job." Andy Wilson; chief executive of the North York Moors National Park; said: "It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There has not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. It would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand." An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches don't seem to be doing anything good." The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action. Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident." The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it; after some googling I found some reference to re-seating all the parts; but no change. The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell specific one; ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT power connectors; I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob or a PSU prob.

HAM,    Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds* (1851); Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them; he observes; "like a mushroom; seems to have sprung up in the night; or; like a frog in Cheapside; to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard; unknown; uninvented; the next it pervaded London."   Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phrase itself; or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?   And to what event or events does it refer?   I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch Phrases.*

HAM,    Hello all; Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?   ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2   When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install. There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.   Thanks again   Darragh

HAM,    http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802B       The Disappearing Alliance By Dale Franks 10/08/2002     For over two generations; the countries of Western Europe have been our closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.   Tragically; a generation from now; we may be bitter adversaries.   Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed "progressive transnationalism". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism; the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry); a redefinition of democracy; and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations.   The European Union; itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations; is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament; the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President; who face few limits to their power. Instead of a limited; consensual form of government; where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws; the EU has an appointed; oligarchic executive; along with a large attendant bureaucracy; whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover; the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.   European criticism of America is on the rise; and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy is so large; and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear

Do a wget of a file of known length; in a script that runs "date" before and after (or equivalent).   Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing; speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be quite another.

Theoretically it should drop in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot and maybe a new kernel (and grub; but I have long before put those to v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself; though.   _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net> http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each; but there are chipsets and drives with known DMA issues as well.   > Normally; even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it; > it simply don't be able to make the change; and that's it. The problem IIRC > is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as > expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)   Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you won't be able to read data off it relably; and that's about it. No end_of_the_world problems; and easily fixed.   > I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting > the DMA tip in the %description :-)   My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same box; and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in "kudzu-speak". I agree that the %description is the best place for the tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or having that media currently in the drive.

HAM,    Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat; Violence...   A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?     http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html     Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a  sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.   Steve Gardiner; 41; claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in  Upton Road; Plumstead; in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley  in just four weeks.   Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside  the house at about 7.15am; on Wednesday; September 25; while his security  cameras captured it on film.   The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and  two-and-a-half-foot high; with a large body.   He said: "It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of  a hunter.   "It looked at me calmly before moving on."   The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had  been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news  of the sighting.   His wife; Karen; 41; later checked the tape which had captured grainy images  of the large cat prowling through their garden.   She said: "I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate  for it to get hurt."   Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their  usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at "nothing" in the garden but barked  that morning.   He warned: "I don't think these cats are dangerous but; if cornered; they  might jump you."   Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead  Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.   If you have seen the big cat; call News Shopper on 01689 885712.   12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002       _________________________________________________________________ Send and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com

Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit; too.   In particular; there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to the term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.   Yep; I know he said all holy books.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the "first sale" principle of fair use in the US.  For example; audio recordings have such an exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC); which is why you can't (legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products -- there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such privileges on.     > Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you  > (and the entertainment industry; it seems) can't be creative enough to come  > up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't  > take it out on the rest of us.     The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make money doing something; they'll actually burn money to make sure no "industry outsider" can either for all intents and purposes; control is more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a profit.  They don't need your carrot; so they only engage in reasonable business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick; and few people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically "investigated" by the DoJ for anti-trust; collusion; and similar activities; but that is mostly just for show.   Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to its own stupidity; but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.  
HAM,    thx for the thoughts gentlemen (yes as someone said i use terms loosely) -   more than cool --->   quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.   implementation: point about hooking to usb; wires; etc. AGREE 100%. these implementations are super clunky; attachable camera needs to be integrated a la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i think.   adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is; this is far more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in family packs etc. but yes; the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network efx.   content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.   display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?   misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial; who needs it; i get better resultion elswhere.  and yet; it had great decentralizing impact - the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera; and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also; SMS didn't take off because its easy; it took off because it costs less.  its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality; SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.   ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..

What it boils down to is that only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company.  What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively still exists (literally the same families); but they now hold top executive and management positions in the major French firms and the government; positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not officially of course; but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place.  Even for a young French blue blood; strict age hierarchies keep them from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them); but I suspect this may hold true for other European countries as well.     After all those "revolutions"; France is still nothing more than a thinly veiled old-school aristocracy; with all the trappings.

There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that even for the native US population; fertility had jumped in the last decade and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2; but not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile non-native population; the article implied the US was going to have a significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well; the population would overall be more youthful; with associated implications for being able to fund social programs; military spending; consumer spending; etc.   Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.   Some actual data for the US are here:   http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf Part of: http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html

Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words; it is not intended as a wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in a city; the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the earth's surface.

HAM,    Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes; with  no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to  be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve; with a few people; a la  Wilt Chamberlain; having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts;  ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more  partners than women.  I have no idea; being a statistical ignoramus; whether  the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely  promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get  even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other  men.      http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html   <<For example; the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women  is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an  individual with 100 partners. For men; the mean is approximately 15 and we  find an individual with 800 partners; which is almost 50 times larger than  the mean! So; somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just  one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>     As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme  promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the  Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses  how; in the gay politics of the time; there was a sub-culture of what you  might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having  many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an  explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.     That view seems to have died; in more ways than one. Part of the point of  Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played  in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz; among so many  others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that  there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.

HAM,    An old Indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A58173-2002Mar7&notFound=true   Slaughter in the Name of God By Salman Rushdie Friday; March 8; 2002; Page A33 Washington Post   The defining image of the week; for me; is of a small child's burned and  blackened arm; its tiny fingers curled into a fist; protruding from the  remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad; Gujarat; in India. The murder  of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily  killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in  Nellie; Assam; in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring  village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the  horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination:  They bear witness to our particular gift; always most dazzlingly in  evidence at times of religious unrest; for dousing our children in  kerosene and setting them alight; or cutting their throats; or  smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length  of wood.   I say "our" because I write as an Indian man; born and bred; who loves  India deeply and knows that what one of us does today; any of us is  potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's  strengths; then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry?  Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because; as India  undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a  decade; many people have not been sounding anything like angry; ashamed  or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's  unwillingness to defend the citizens of India; without regard to  religion; by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to  the same sentiments as the nation in general.   Meanwhile; India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering  the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control.  (It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party; the Bharatiya  Janata Party (BJP); or Indian People's Party; and the Hindu extremists  of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP); or World Hindu Council; are sister  organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some  international commentators; such as Britain's Independent newspaper;  urge us to "beware excess pessimism."   The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used  to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is;  folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy;  and if; once in a while; it lets off a little crazy religious steam; we  mustn't let that distort the picture.   Of course; there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992;  when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya; which  they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram; Hindu  fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some  Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the  train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful; atavistic echoes  of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the  partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.   The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and  insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal  Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a  coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's  more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together.  But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country; the  BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP  firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic  agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?   The electoral failure of the BJP is thus; in all probability; the spark  that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the  site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead  were coming from -- and there are; reprehensibly; idiotically;  tragically; Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee  has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and  wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.   The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi; in a letter to India's  president; K. R. Narayanan; blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP  hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing "too little too  late." She pins the blame firmly on the "motivated; well-planned out and  provocative actions" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer; the  Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul; speaking in India just a week before the  violence erupted; denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the  nationalist movement.   The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced; and Mahasveta Devi in  her letter demands "stern legal action" against them. But the VHP is  determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such  public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting  them; Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces  the Nobel award.   The political discourse matters; and explains a good deal. But there's  something beneath it; something we don't want to look in the face:  namely; that in India; as elsewhere in our darkening world; religion is  the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes; mere innocence is no  excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue; speaking of religion in  the fashionable language of "respect." What is there to respect in any  of this; or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around  the world in religion's dreaded name? How well; with what fatal results;  religion erects totems; and how willing we are to kill for them! And  when we've done it often enough; the deadening of affect that results  makes it easier to do it again.   So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in  India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.

Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.   A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past?   Certainly not Christianity; Islam; etc. B) "How it is currently being expressed" amounts to a tacit  acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and  people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive  expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less  sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke  the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of  society. C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also  aren't 'found in the wild'.   (By "primitive expression"; I don't mean to slight any society; but that  there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized  behavior (killing infants; women to break religious blue laws; etc.).   The US has only really been mostly free of "primitive expression" for  40-50 years; although large categories; including serious religious  conflict; were settled quite a while ago.)   D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud; recently more or  less concluded; is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated  by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article  pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical  integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools;  government; political party; etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage  of British conquest; but who doesn't?)   (I couldn't find the article I remember; but here are a couple of others:) http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true   'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and  cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and  religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant;  and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part  of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican; or  nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.     In 1968; Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the  Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But  violence quickly broke out; with ancient religious animosities fueling  the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both  sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by  far was the IRA; fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united  Ireland   The provincial police force estimates that about 3;600 people were  killed during the 30-year conflict known; with characteristic Northern  Ireland understatement; as "The Troubles."'   >2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.   That's fine; as it would be an inappropriate concentration.  It would be  difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way.  I'd be  happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.   >3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.

It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben; Kevin and Bill are making too strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're some sort of monsters; violent ones no less.   Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters; who will stoop to any level to get their way.   Yeah sure Dave; whatever you need to believe.   The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude; to be sure; but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward.  How is that being monstrous?   Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's perception of them?  If you haven't already; contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness.      9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss       Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand     It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something they usually try learning about it.  They read up; ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools.   What Dave does is just the opposite.   Posts a link to something he doesn't understand Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it. Expects others to do research for him Abuses anyone who tries to help him Pontificates; incorrectly; about only part of the issue Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy Tries making the educated people look like fools. Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off. Exposes any private e-mail they write; out of context. Deflects and runs off to some new topic; repeats from #1 His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying.   One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  "It's like that movie The Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room. The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot."   Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all; why would good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love; right?  To hell with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain; he savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing all the trouble.   We've news for you Dave; we're wise to your tactics and we're talking amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir. That's where we're coming from.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours. Still have work to do on the sample file; I want to look into the RFC for time-date specs; and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have to prepare for Seybold tomorrow; and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also; it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any deal-stoppers.   Hell yeah there are deal stoppers; like nobody wants it nor will they use     The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage!!!   Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected!   Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter fucking nonsense.  This past weekend; the blogosphere excoriates him for his 'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he's still recovering?   Uh; Dave; if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore; none whatsoever.      9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss         Dave is Scary on 9/11   Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:     Note: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.

People are objecting all over.          9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss         Referral log funnies     Every now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to us.

Scripting News is full of examples.   So we found it surprising; as did many others; when Luserland software tried to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:   http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336   This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development efforts; and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS 1.0 stuff - indeed; he complained about it bitterly at the time.   Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!   Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:   Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK; he's just against stupid patents. In the spirit of Touch of Grey; Tim man; patents are lock-in of the worst kind. There's no way to route around them.    9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss         When's a Permalink not a Permalink?     When Dave writes an item; then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to nothing at that point. So apparently the "perma-" part in permalink is permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!      9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss

Owen   http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-shi2.htm *Q AND A SECTION*   *SHIVER MY TIMBERS*   /From Tad Spencer/: "Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver  my timbers/ originated?"   This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be  better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any  actual sailors' usage.   It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or  other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver; or shake; so implying a  calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain  Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: "I won't thrash you Tom.  Shiver my timbers if I do".   It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years  later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt  saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure  Island/: "Cross me; and you'll go where many a good man's gone before  you ... some to the yard-arm; shiver my timbers; and some by the board;  and all to feed the fishes". Since then; it's mainly been the preserve  of second-rate seafaring yarns.

The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.   Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed; it is placed in a "public" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change; and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.       GATHERING THE DATA   While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air; a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30;000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75;000 cubic kilometers of air.   The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their "brightness" - varies according to temperature.   Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.       VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS   A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a "remarkable" level of agreement between the two.   To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units; Christy compared temperature readings recorded by "radiosonde" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.   He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.   "The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement;" Christy said. "If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites; that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."   The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe; the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.   Globally; however; the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.   "These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet;" Christy said. "They are not representative of the total globe."   Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world; usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere; the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.   While there are more than 1;000 radiosonde launch sites globally; the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland; Trinidad; Truk Island and Alaska.   In an earlier study; an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade; which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time; Christy said.       GLOBAL COVERAGE   One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.   The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions; including Antarctica; the Brazilian rain forests; the Sahara Desert and Greenland.   The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5;000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.   Most of these thermometers; which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground; are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries; these thermometers are most often found at airports.   The ground-based network is extensive in North America; Europe; Russia; China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa; South America; Australia and across much of Southern Asia.   Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "Radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world; usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.   While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world; they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1;000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world; that would equal approximately one for every 195;000 square miles of the Earth's surface.   Water temperatures; which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures; come from thermometers on piers and buoys; and aboard "ships of opportunity." The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage; tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes; and in harbors.   In the past 12 years; a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established; gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU   With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years; a method was devised to merge all the data into a single; consistent time series.   Each satellite has its own bias that; if not calculated and removed; would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years; and were sufficient to determine these biases.   Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations; the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)   To check the final product; comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above; and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS   Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities; the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads; parking lots; runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY   While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature; this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.   The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard; nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.   Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.       THE SCIENTISTS   In 1996; Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored "for developing a global; precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites; fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."   AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards; and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.   In 1991; Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.       DR. JOHN CHRISTY   Christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987; after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno; his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary; and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.   He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign; IL; 1983-87; an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota; 1981-82; and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College; 1980-81.   He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion; S.D.; 1978-82; and as science master at Baptist High School; Nyeri; Kenya; 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.   Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center; and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an "invited key contributor" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change; and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.       DR. ROY SPENCER   Spencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison; WI; in 1981; after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC; 1984-87; before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.   He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.       BIBLIOGRAPHY   (1) J.R. Christy; 1995; "Climatic Change;" Vol. 31; pp. 455-474.   (2) J.R. Christy; R.W. Spencer and R.T.

HAM,      For anyone to fully bury global warming; they would have to bury the Greens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth; it is to industrial civilization.   The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.   Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming; people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the "Medieval Warm Period".  Said period was warmer than what we have now; and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.   In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does; and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.   Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.   More water vapor can increase temperatuers; but that also leads to more clouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it; so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.

An interesting issue might be how it affects employment.   Still; it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a difference.     The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous. Worse than the cost of the tax itself.   Me: I hate coffee anyway.

HAM,    Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at part of the equation.   America has; in fact; moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There is an element of LUCK; even if only being in the right place at the right time; to go that high.   Beyond the Forbes List; there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model; for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.   Most people; of course; aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the rest of us who tend to sort.   There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree at least in part; but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.   And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list; or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.   Differences due to merit; when they are perceived as such; generate far more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven. Superior performance; often not.     > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Geege > Schuman > Sent: Monday; September 23; 2002 4:44 PM > To: R.

The details are really gross and complicated.   Perhaps the stations cannot publish digital playlists; but you can get them from www.starcd.com anyway.

Not very muddied at all.     What does that exactly have to do with the statement that distruption of peacable political assembly has become a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation not a judgement; comment; approval.  You've focused on the word "muddy" to use it in a different context than the one I posted.   Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.

In my experience; this protest behavior is really only an issue in "ultra-liberal" coastal cities; which is where I normally live.  It is part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.     For comparison; contrast this with the character of the arguably more serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite; if heated and aggressive; and those involve a far greater percentage of the local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests I've seen; the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets results.  Some of their tactics; such as the practice of many businesses and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies; have been very effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their protests as impolite; rude; or violent; but then they have more to lose.

IMHO.   BS> Bill     No offense or anything; but there's a difference between holding a sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.   My sole point; as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more to this game than just being an angry; liberal youth.  (Which is the gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing; at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record; I don't support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a right to be heard; and I think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place.   My point; (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts we have) in a shoutout; but rather in a difference of opinion.   He has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.   I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case; the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative; offensive and constitutionally challengable means; but its not simply due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story; we just dont' know it all.   I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:   Screaming != Free speech on all cases. Dissent = Free speech; provided you follow what has been laid down by the Supremes.

HAM,    Normally; I disdain any kind of mysticism; even when it is associated  with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be  the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure; but  related; relaxation techniques including "betagenics";  hypnosis/auto-hypnosis; etc.  (This was one of the many topics I  obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /  G-Force Dyno-Staff.   I have to say however that; having found this while looking for  something completely unrelated; it has some cute truisms.  I  particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally; the  Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes; etc.   To my internal ear; nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular  seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some  religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very  irritating; but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and  contrast with our (my) modern mental models.   I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and  justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.   http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)

The past is dead; The future is imaginary; Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now Moment   How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the  direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.   Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason.   Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions  and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.     purpose of our lives is to be free of all addictive traps; and thus become one with the ocean of Living Love.           sdw@lig.net http://sdw.st Stephen D.

HAM,saben algo del acta de contabilidad i de sam miguel?     
HAM,no nos llego el acta de final de ese examen. nos llegará en febrero dado que enero la universidad está de receso     
HAM,estas en condición de libre por no haber aprobado dos materias en los dos xc3xbaltimos años. aprobaste informática en el 2013 pero en el 2014 no aprobaste ninguna. el problema es que agotaste las 3 reinscripciones posibles. deberías pedir una justificación de inactividad académica argumentando los motivos por los cuales quedaste libre en 3 oportunidades y no pudiste terminar. reglamentariamente; solo podes comenzar la carrera nuevamente desde cero si no pedís una excepción      
HAM,pueden ver este caso     
HAM,porque tenes que mirar por finales para ver la situación final en cada materia. esa es la condición en que terminaste la cursada

HAM, Subject: storage model change : commodity delta  dear all ,  i change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value  before .  the total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at  given  status ( initial conditions ) .  the way i calculate the unit value is  ( total pv - s * capacity taken ) / total capacity  which could suffer some negative numbers since s , the spot price could be  very high . the correct way is to define the s as the average injection gas  price , but  this would be troublesome to compute .  by switching to total pv , the delta can be interpreted as total commodity  delta for the  hedge . actually , duffie also suggested using the total pv as the output in  his audit  review .  i have attached the xll model below .  zimin

HAM, Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .

HAM, Subject: petrochem desk  i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to  curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in  april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked  about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been  around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john  nowlan is indeed the head of the group .  from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at  least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday  during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex  component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could  then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors  ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .  nelson

HAM, Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731

HAM, Subject: status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with  well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet .  an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .

HAM, Subject: working paper list & etc  dear vince :  i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning tool . several of them , however , do contain innovations .  i have asked ms . de claris to forward a copy to you .  as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn .  i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street .  the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) is : if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ?  i look forward to hearing from you soon .  best regards  joao
HAM, Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  executive summary :  sb - 7 x gives dept . of water and resources given legislative authority to  undertake short - term power purchases with no price cap through feb . 2 nd  new legislation ( ab - 1 x and sb - 6 x ) would seek ( 1 ) long - term contracts with 5 . 5  cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing  authority  the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to  significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of  sb - 7 x .  the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance  new generation capacity and conservation measures  negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility  bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of  utility parents  state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state  treasury ; socal edison misses more payments  bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to  split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or  issue  bonds to deal with the rest .  as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility  holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves  is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread  public outrage about a  bailout  of private price - gouging companies with  taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and  the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial  political stance for the governor .  but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a  shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches  of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite  willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both  sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court  that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country ' s economy  would  suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor ' s political future would  suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a  bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the  utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during  bankruptcy  procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of  the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state  government  determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in  a major way .  senator burton ' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically  to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a  california power and  conservation  financing authority ,  with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent  domain . it would finance new power plants , and  consider the feasibility and  public  interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission  facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities .   as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the  bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has  shifted  in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to  maybe we ' ve run this thing  out as far as we can .  but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is  still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off  over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities '  holding  company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it  possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate  accelerated payment .  5 . default update - thursday  socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange .  after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the  california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling  them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects  its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today ,  leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources .  while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e ' s and socal ' s  ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to  pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term .  the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed  california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3  billion from the state general fund in advance of this year ' s expected fiscal  surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future  revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is  unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of  repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating  agencies .  5 . bush policies  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved in the california crisis .  president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments ,  which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root  of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be  unanimously opposed to long - term price caps .  however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration ,  according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is  significant concern that pg & e ' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to  stop shipments of gas through pg & e ' s pipeline . the risk would be that the  pipeline could  go dry  , causing significant and possibly dangerous  disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this  problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate  gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the  electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant  defaults .

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris

HAM, Subject: stephen bennett  norma ,  i fully concur . what can we do about it ? can we change the job classification  retroactively ?  vince  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 12 / 12 / 2000  02 : 41 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from : mike a roberts 12 / 09 / 2000 10 : 33 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an   under hire .  he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive  promotion .   at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as  professional meteorologist .  in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a  new - hire  to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

HAM, Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures  as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will  have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week .  ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would  authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term  contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a  price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities ,  and the state are likely to resume .  a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the  markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority  with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency . yet the legislation also says  the authority may issue bonds ,  exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and  buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project .  the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding .  2 . default update  3 . bush  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved

HAM, Subject: my model for spikes  dear dr . kaminski ,  i was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis  the first of the preprints that i recently authored on my model for spikes in  power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power . in this  regard , i have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the  center for energy finance education and research and the institute for  computational finance at the ut austin . right now i am also in the process of  forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be  interested in receiving this preprint . please let me know if you might be  interested in receiving this preprint .  i look forward to hearing from you .  sincerely yours ,  valery kholodnyi  manager of quantitative analysis  research and analytics group  txu energy trading  ps . here are the main preprints that i have recently authored on my model for  spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power :  1 . valery a . kholodnyi , the stochastic process for power prices with spikes  and  valuation of european contingent claims on power , preprint , txu - rag - 01 / 00 ,  july  2000 .  2 . valery a . khlolodnyi , valuation of a swing option on power with spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 05 / 00 , august , 2000 .  3 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a spark spread option on power with  spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 21 / 00 , november 2000 .  4 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of european contingent claims on power at  two  distinct points on the grid with spikes in both power prices , preprint  txu - rag - 24 / 00 , november 2000 .  5 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a transmission option on power with  spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 25 / 00 , november 2000 .  as i have indicated to you in my previous e - mail , contrary to the standard  approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a  stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of  spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian  process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is  markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit  valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that  the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the  absence of spikes .

HAM, Subject: re : seeking opportunity in computational finance  dear vince :  thanks for your response .  i am not a programmer , nor a  quant  . i am an expert in excel and otherwise  have advanced skills in the remaining msoffice suite . beyond that i have  extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel  on projects from networks to databases , and in particular , automation .  for instance , the first generation of the risk analytics system that i  designed for quantlab was done in excel . in subsequent generations of the  system , excel served only as the gui - given its extreme flexibility - and a  sql database operated underneath ( compaq servers , raid array ) , integrating  real - time operations for all components of the system .  the research team at quantlab used many leading edge modelling  methodologies , such as genetic algorithms , neural networks , principal  component analysis , kernel density estimation , fast kernel regression ,  hidden markov modelling and many other pattern recognition , walk - forward  back testing , and other simulation techniques .  i was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading  experience , and therefore , felt that i played a critical role in the  application and implementation of each of the system components from data  mining to research to signal generation to execution . beyond that , i was  uniquely qualified to articulate the project ' s mission to investors , and  therefore , was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and  otherwise - from our network .  althought i did not ask specifically , i surmise from your question that you  are leading a research effort . i believe that my skill set is best served  as a liaison between research and trading , since i speak both languages . i  believe that i possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged  in a group , project or product management role to integrate and streamline  diverse systems and processes ; a common scenario in most proprietary  development settings today .  in closing , i would like to learn more about enron and the financial  technology effort therein through further discussion with you , or if that is  not appropriate , someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me .  i look forward to your thoughts .  best regards ,  paul  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com [ mailto : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com ]  sent : tuesday , november 14 , 2000 4 : 30 pm  to : epr @ pipeline . com  subject : re : seeking opportunity in computational finance  paul ,  can you give me more information about your computer skills ?  my group is very hands - on oriented and computer programming is a critical  skill .  vince   paul rowady  on 11 / 14 / 2000 04 : 09 : 43 pm  to :  vince kaminski   cc :  subject : seeking opportunity in computational finance  dear vince :  in following up on my voicemail message today , i attach my resume below for  your review and consideration .  it ' s ironic that you called while i was putting the message together . i  will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience .  best regards ,  paul  e . paul rowady , jr .  2300 west alabama , suite 69  houston , texas 77098  713 - 807 - 8624 home / fax  713 - 539 - 4541 mobile  epr @ pipeline . com  ( see attached file : paul rowady 2 . doc )

HAM, Subject: pac enrollment  last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to  become a  million dollar pac  . enron employees , who provide all of the  funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,  becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new  challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal  employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent  contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please  join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your  contribution .  the enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public  policy . our pac funds support local , state and federal candidates , of both  parties , who support open markets , deregulation and customer choice . amounts  contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with  federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal  election campaign act . while our pac has grown thanks to our employee  contributions , it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of  those who oppose these ideals .  this year , as always , we face challenges and opportunities for every one of  our businesses , including such issues as taxation and regulation of  e - commerce , electric industry restructuring , regulation of derivatives ,  international trade and investment legislation , pipeline safety , local and  state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and  a variety of environmental and tax issues . enron has a long and successful  track record of supporting and advancing good public policy . that track  record depends on access to and regular communication with , decision makers .  the pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care  about what they are doing .  one of the best things about enron is that we don  , t just take things as they  are . we challenge the status quo . we ask why . we change things . the pac  helps us do that . we need you to help the pac . sign up today - and please  consider the following contribution guidelines :  manager $ 500 / year  director $ 750 / year  sr . director / general manager $ 1 , 000 / year  vice president $ 2 , 500 / year  sr . vp / managing director $ 3 , 500 / year  executive committee $ 5 , 000 / year  all contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions .  you are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and  enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their  contribution or their decision not to contribute . you may refuse to  contribute without fear of reprisal .  only u . s . citizens and resident - aliens living in the u . s . can contribute to  the enron pac . the maximum contribution is $ 5 , 000 per year per individual .  an individual may not contribute more than $ 25 , 000 to all federal candidates  and committees within a calendar year . the law requires that enron report  name , address , employer and occupation for every person who contributes over  $ 200 / year .  no portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for  federal income tax purposes .  thanks for your support ! sign up now , or revise your current contribution  level by connecting with the pac intranet site :  http : / / pacmembers . enron . com
HAM, Subject: precious metals var  jason ,  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the  issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are  proposing . the var model , as i illustrated , is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions , prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price . the var model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period .  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm  in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict .  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help  to prioritise my time . i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and  tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice .  rac will also assist in the process .  please contact me if you have any further questions ,  kirstee  x 34529

HAM, Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun ,  cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may  day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the  excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting  loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from  vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems  to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded  email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in  the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to  mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on  the current state of enron credit -  a fish rots from the head .   finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this  duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear -  that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their  exisiting  infrastructure  ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear ,  read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports ,  because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make  the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work  here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron  credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should  also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of  the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for  duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run  the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also  need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both  amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions ,  but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to  get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have  already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more  time ?  vasant

HAM, Subject: organization announcement  enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned  subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has  conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner  allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their  requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,  with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in  internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change  its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically  sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are  significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial  potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business  e - commerce venture .  effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing  unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic  sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset  operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus  on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand  for products and services with the objective of creating a future  business - to - business e - commerce venture .  it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director ,  will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike  mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology .  george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior  executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron  south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief  executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief  executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . (  tgs  ) from june  1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial  positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron  international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline  company .  please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating  george in his new role with the company .
HAM, Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked  change  for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to

HAM, Subject: var  david ,  during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor  and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .  we have agreed on the following :  1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .  2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be  modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates .  3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions .  this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .  vince

HAM, Subject: london exotica library migration  fyi  - exotic library :  issue : the london version is different from the houston version .  the problem is that some bugs in the london version were found .  temporary solution : bugs were immediately fixed at a local level .  permanent solution : the london exotic version will be replaced by the  houston exotic version .  the houston version is expected to be robust .  sharad ( london research ) is spending this coming week in houston .  when sharad is back to london , the houston version will replace the london  version .  approach : steven leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that  will involve it to fully test the similarity of the two versions .  the procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement .  hopefully , no discrepancies will be found .  in the adverse case it happens , it will be necessary to conduct an analysis  to decide what is wrong .  if necessary further testing and development has to take place .  rodrigo

HAM, Subject: organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .

the direction of prices , obviously is  the concern of any trader . we realize that  technological innovation will continue to drive down prices , but are still  interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall ,  if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where you  could see prices stable or rising for some length of time ,  if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious  amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing ,  and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect on  prices of new technologies .  the term  bandwidth  might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity , but could  also incompass dark fiber , or ip transit and transport  pricing .  2 . during the last year , enron purchased a company known as  warpspeed  in  order to acquire their metarouter technology . to quote from the enron press  release :   metarouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the  optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in  the world . capable of processing thousands of connections per second ,  metarouter significantly enhances enron  , s ability to automate circuit  provisioning .   there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of  the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,  will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it  address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just  to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?  the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter  technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are  implementing this technology .  3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas  such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what  value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of  stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to  ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .  the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual  customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful  history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute  averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the  distribution of load looks like .  i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our  concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these  topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be  reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe  in the form of a talk here at enron .  again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again  soon .  stinson  nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm  to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com  subject : stanford project  hello vince and stinson ,  first of all ,  best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !  if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together  some time to have dinner .  i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding  it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is  eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !  we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would  hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into  the  problem / opportunity generation environment .  that really helps the  student  to develop a realistic vision about their research .  perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter ,  say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of  course  you could visit us before that too .  with my warmest wishes ,  nick
HAM, Subject: update : ffvols  ted ,  an update on the implementation for ffvols :  ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations  ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var  calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the  implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong  winter prices .  ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the  historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders  will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm  and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 .  ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology  ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio  of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some  implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio  indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the  historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems  appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical  numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied .  ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and  if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production  methodology .  of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different  indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a  sensible compromise of the different methods .  regards  naveen

HAM, Subject: a colossal and dangerous failure - cera alert  title : a colossal and dangerous failure  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2185  overview : western energy  * california governor stays the course  california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to  date regarding the state  , s power crisis in his annual state of the state  address on january 8 , 2001 . echoing many of his previous positions on what he  perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure , the governor  labeled the state  , s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous  failure . among other actions , he launched new initiatives valued at $ 1  billion to encourage conservation , provide financing and land to new  generators , grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of  transactions to manage electricity costs , and increase regulatory scrutiny of  existing market suppliers . the governor also called for a greater role for  the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants .  the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the  steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery . details regarding  sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming . although he  stated that california  , s investor - owned utilities must not be allowed to go  bankrupt , no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given . the financial  community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide  financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california  edison . at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to  guarantee their solvency .  the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for  what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the  wholesale market . merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the  state , and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their  operations , jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid . new , more severe  sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what  investigators find as unreasonable profits .  a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor  , s address  indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an  energy crisis . although the 33 percent growth in the state  , s economy over the  past ten years has nearly outstripped the state  , s and surrounding region  , s  supplies of power , the bulk of the governor  , s statements continue to focus on  the culpability of power producers , rather than the serious supply shortfall .  though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction  of new generating plants , increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of  sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers  and the financial community that the investment climate in california is  excessively risky .  * * end * *  follow above url for complete report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 ,  shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future  in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit  http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek /  e - mail category : alert  cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy ,  to make changes to your cera . com account go to :  forgot your username and password ? go to :  http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

 toshiba is uniting digital , mobile and network innovations  in a bold new vision of information technology for today  and tomorrow . take a closer look at life in the new digital age .  and imagine how good it can be . visit toshiba . com for more details .  the real wolf  reckonings  by paul krugman  ecently i received a letter from an economist i respect , chiding me  for my  naderite  columns on the california energy crisis . he just  didn ' t believe that market manipulation by power companies could  possibly be an important issue ; it sounded too much to him like the  sort of thing one hears from knee - jerk leftists , who blame greedy  capitalists for every problem , be it third - world poverty or high  apartment rents . the left has cried  wolf !  so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators  gaming the system  have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that  generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market   * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say  apparently   because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls  megawatt  laundering   * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to  imports  from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently :  i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient .   the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan  a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout  from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ?

HAM, Subject: calculating bid - ask prices  this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for  trading future of a movie ' s gross box office receipt . rich sent to many  people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide  some feedback .  i think the idea ( see below ) might be applicable to other parts of enron . we  can call it  dynamic bid - ask price process  .  in fact , we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is  submitted to the system within a specified amount of time . the final  ( clearing ) bid and ask prices are just the last  tentative  price shown to  the public before the bidding period ends . ( so the customers can see the  final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish . )  i think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via  enrononline . com .  - chonawee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron on  04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 48 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  chonawee supatgiat  04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 40 pm  to : richard dimichele / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron @ enron , cynthia harkness / enron  communications @ enron communications , greg wolfe / hou / ect @ ect , james  ginty / enron communications @ enron communications , jim fallon / enron  communications @ enron communications , kelly kimberly / enron  communications @ enron communications , kevin howard / enron communications @ enron  communications , key kasravi / enron communications @ enron communications ,  kristin albrecht / enron communications @ enron communications , kristina  mordaunt / enron communications @ enron communications , martin  lin / contractor / enron communications @ enron communications , paul racicot / enron  communications @ enron communications , zachary mccarroll / enron  communications @ enron communications , martin lin / contractor / enron  communications @ enron communications  subject : calculating bid - ask prices  i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to  forecast it . otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market ,  we may have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and we may end up taking some  positions . you know , as russ and martin pointed out , we cannot fight with the  studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the  price easily .  one way to ensure the balance of the bid - ask orders is to embed an exchange  system inside our bid - ask prices front end . each week , we have a trading  period . during the period , instead of posting bid - ask prices , we post   tentative  bid - ask prices , then we ask our customers to submit their  acceptable buying or selling price . these  tentative  bid - ask prices get  updated and are shown to the public . of course , customers can revise / withdraw  their bids anytime during the trading period . at the end of the period , we  calculate and post the final bid and ask prices . the seller who submits lower  selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price . the buyer  who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask  price . next week , we repeat the same process .  this way , we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a  broker where we don ' t take any position at all . we make profit from those  bid - ask spread . we don ' t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and  insiders ' trading because we don ' t have to take any position . let the market  be the one who decides the price .  if we maintain our net position as zero , at the end , when all the actual  gross box office numbers are reported in those publications , our customers  with open long / short positions are perfectly matched . using the  mark - to - market charge can reduce credit risk .  thanks ,  - chonawee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron on  04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 24 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  chonawee supatgiat  04 / 20 / 2001 04 : 31 pm  to : richard dimichele / enron communications @ enron communications , key  kasravi / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : martin lin / contractor / enron communications @ enron communications  subject : some more input  hi rich and key ,  again i think your idea is very good . i think that we , as a market maker , can  reduce our credit risk ( risk of default ) if we do the  mark - to - market   charging . that is , each week when we release a new expected value of the  gross box office receipt , we balance all the opening positions the same way  as in a regular future market . this way , we can give margin calls to the  couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money .  in the last paragraph , i think the gross box office can also be determined  from the market itself ( i . e . , if there are lots of buyers , our offer price  should go up . )  we can offer other derivative products such as options as well .  - chonawee

HAM, Subject: hedge effectiveness test for fair value hedges  gentlemen :  we have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility  reduction method ( roger , i ' ve attached a copy of our article in case you  hadn ' t seen it ) . however , there continued to be a quibble about how to  create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process .  last week the consulting arm of a  big five  accounting firm indicated that  the following method proposed by us would be acceptable . we believe this  method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest  rate differences from overlapping (  rolling  ) quarters .  method :  1 ) calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios , using historical  rates from the most recent , say , two years . ( note : no overlap ) . this  results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios ( approximately 247 trading  days per  year ) .  example :  if the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this :  19980801 6 . 5 6 . 6 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 2  19980802 6 . 3 6 . 3 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9  19980803 6 . 6 6 . 8 6 . 9 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1  then the change from 8 / 1 / 98 to 8 / 2 / 98 is :  6 . 3 / 6 . 5 6 . 3 / 6 . 6 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 / 7 . 1  and the change from 8 / 2 / 98 to 8 / 3 / 98 is :  6 . 6 / 6 . 3 6 . 8 / 6 . 3 6 . 9 / 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 / 6 . 9  2 ) randomly select 62 of these  ratio  vectors ( approx . 62 trading days in a  quarter ) .  3 ) multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ( ie , the 62  6 mo ratios are multiplied together , the 62 lyr ratios are multiplied  togeter , etc . ) . the result represents a single quarterly yield curve  transformation . apply it to  today ' s  yield curve . the resulting yield  curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates  4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are  generated , say 100 .  5 ) proceed with testing process .  i would be interested in your comments .  leslie abreo  andrew kalotay associates , inc .  61 broadway , ste 3025  new york ny 10006  phone : ( 212 ) 482 0900  fax : ( 212 ) 482 0529  email : leslie . abreo @ kalotay . com  visit aka ' s website at http : / / www . kalotay . com  - fasl 33 article . pdf

HAM, Subject: re : trip to houston  another student invited by tom gros to come next wednesday .  - - stinson  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 02 / 10 / 2000  05 : 25 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  paulo rocha e oliveira on 02 / 10 / 2000 12 : 04 : 56 pm  to :  stinson gibner   cc :  subject : re : trip to houston  stinson ,  thank you for your e - mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 . i don ' t  have a currect resume , but if i did it would say that i graduated from  princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came straight to mit for a  phd in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is  pricing substitute products on the internet  , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this reseach is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g ,  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferrable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential eliminations of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .

HAM, Subject: proj . x analytics diligence  paul ,  vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the  trading analytics . there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a  two day time period . i think a reasonable start would be the following :  1 . obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been  implemented in order to verify profitability , and p / l volatility of each .  2 . review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare  these to projections for trading income .  3 . review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a  change of ownership would not have adverse consequences , i . e . are there  guarantees of continued access using the current systems ?  4 . review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets ? it is far from  clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the  current limited  electronic  liquidity .  5 . review , at least qualitatively , the current trading strategies being  used . try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these  strategies will disappear as other ' s implement similar trading models . what  is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage .  6 . review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will  be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and  outdated .  7 . try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading  technology to enron ' s other markets , given the illiquidity of these markets  as compared to the financial equity markets .  if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis , we would  probably want to run their system on a test set of data .  let me know if you have other suggestions .  - - stinson

HAM, Subject: re : trying to find fat tails  naveen ,  i was trying to find  fat tails  . i looked at ng prompt month prices '  log - returns for 5 years 9 months .  on the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative  probability function with normal  cumulative for this time series ( standardized : mean subtracted , divided by  stdev ) . the effect of fat tails  is not pronounced so much . the  fat tails  effect was much more visible on  your plot when you looked at the  oct - 00 prices log - returns versus my time series of prompt month ' s prices .  the shape of the distribution is different from normal , though , and fits well  with the volatility switching model .  tanya .

HAM, Subject: re : clayton vernon  i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is  temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him . according to enron  policy , an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or  better . this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one  organization to the another . this sounds like a  work ethic  issue to me and  the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he  is temporarily successful . but if kevin presto knows the situation and he  still wants vernon in the end , i will push for an exception as this satisfies  our obligation to be forthright . please keep me informed of clayton ' s  progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem  employee . thanks .  sheila  vince j kaminski  07 / 28 / 2000 08 : 35 am  to : kevin m presto / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , sheila walton / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  subject : clayton vernon  kevin ,  vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton  received a conditional approval contingent  upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate  exact definition of the deliverables  and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for  transfer will be rejected . anything else  would be highly demoralizing to everybody .  clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered )  though he was advertising  the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be  aware of it , because i have  serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity .  vince

HAM, Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define  non - firm  ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the  non - firm curve for the region  ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant

HAM, Subject: p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg  b  of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg  b  and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research

HAM, Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit -  a fish rots from the head .   finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting  infrastructure  ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant

HAM, Subject: enron europe organisational changes  once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this  year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on  co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts  in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very  closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric  will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing  arcos .  we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination  responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti  will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric  shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and  portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .  the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread  position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility  for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more  likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas  markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and  the continental gas team .  ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also  head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power  transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will  pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,  and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to  eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission  responsibilities .  finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team  than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages  our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .  we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these  changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help  make these changes as smooth as possible .  john sherriff  michael brown
HAM, Subject: pjm adds ny prices to edata  message sent from the pjm - customer - info mailing list at  pjm - customer - info @ majordomo . pjm . com :  pjm has launched a pilot version of edata which includes data from the  new york independent system operator . the beta - test period for the pilot is  expected to last approximately 90 days as pjm evaluates the success of using  cross - iso data in edata . if the pilot proves successful , pjm may add data  from  other isos in the future .  this pilot version of edata is a result of the collaboration among the  isos created by the memorandum of understanding signed last year . through the  iso mou process , stakeholders have asked the isos to improve seams issues ,  create like user interfaces , and make it easier to do business between the  isos .  the addition of other iso data to edata has several benefits to users  including  consolidated information , ease of use , less technical support required , and  improved customer service . real - time prices , forecasted / actual loads , tie  line  schedules , and transmission limits are all possible types of information that  may be included in the future .  edata was implemented in october 1998 . there are currently more that  1700 registered users representing over 200 companies . users include  marketers ,  utilities , control areas , state and federal regulators , educational  organizations , financial institutions and others . the tool continues to  attract  30 to 40 new registered users each week . normally , 100 - 300 users are  simultaneously logged onto the system . to become an edata user , submit new  user  information from the edata log in screen from the pjm web site at www . pjm . com .  please do not reply to this message . if you have a question for pjm customer  relations and training , please send an e - mail to custsvc @ pjm . com .  to unsubscribe from this list , send an e - mail to majordomo @ majordomo . pjm . com  containing only the following line in the body of the e - mail :  unsubscribe pjm - customer - info
HAM, Subject: sap timesheets  hello everyone :  thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to  save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with  the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical  order  by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .  the spreadsheet is saved in o : \ research \ common \ sap timesheets \ mmm - dd .  ( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time  period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save  it .  if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,  family  time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes  have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies .  if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time  or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .  there is no code for non - exempt overtime .  this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to  fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will  try and remind you by email the day before .  i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any  other  off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you .  if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .  thanks !  shirley
HAM, Subject: mark - to - market  bob ,  i wanted to continue the analysis on mark - to - market that i had spoken to you  about on the phone .  i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction  by phone , so i am having krishnarao who is in vince ' s group explain the  transaction to you .  krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india , and he has just  returned to houston from india after working with the team here .  he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction . i would  like you to please spend some time with him , and then based on the discussion  please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to  market .  please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from  the indian side . this is a very important transaction for us , and we may  need to repeat this in coming months , hence setting up the system to account  for these maybe well worth it . also , what i am concerned about is that there  will be an enron india ( eipl ) account in india based on indian gaap , and upon  consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us . it is here that  we would like to have mark - to - market accounting . eipl is structured through  mauritius , and then caymen islands .  another key question to consider is that when we m - t - m the transaction in the  us there will be a tax accruing in the year of m - t - m ( say 2000 ) . however , in  india , as a result of the accrual accounting , there will not be any income  showing till the year 2002 or 2003 . we will need to know how that would get  treated , and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the  us . i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied , since none of  the income is being brought back into the us ( remains overseas - subpart - f  and other concerns ) .  finally , we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and  getting a fixed for floating swap in the us ( this is still not allowed to  indian corporates ) . i need you to think about this too , and see if some type  of accounting will solve this issue . krishna knows what i am talking about ,  and will brief you on the same .  krishna - please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here .  look forward to your help and comments . this is going to be an exciting  project for us all .  regards ,  sandeep .

HAM, Subject: remaining work  vince ,  i shipped you the paper along with my note to don . however , i wanted to  share with you what i feel are the remaining  to dos  . specifically ,  1 . we need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original  transformation of enron . specifically , the fallout from deregulation ( take  or pay contract defaults , etc . ) , the impact of the losses from the oil  trading operation , the nationalization of the peruvian pipeline , and the  leveraging up to fend off the carl ichan takeover attempt .  2 . we need to complete / beef up the network strategy section .  3 . finally , the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to   hammer home  the basic principles underlying the transformation .  what do you think ?  hope you have a great weekend .  john  john d . martin  carr p . collins chair in finance  finance department  baylor university  po box 98004  waco , tx 76798  254 - 710 - 4473 ( office )  254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax )  j _ martin @ baylor . edu  web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html

HAM, Subject: ethylene margin collar model  dear all :  let us meet early this afternoon .  here is the overview of the model :  1 ) the ethylene margin collars are priced using asian spread option .  the forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk .  the correlation between the ethylene and ethylene cost starts from the  historical spot correlation 50 % and grows with the maturity .  2 ) the overall 40 mm payout cap is modeled sepereately .  i fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model  with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side . the model  produces  trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data .  then the expected payoff is computed through simulation .  at the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results .  zimin

the dissertation hasn ' t been reviewed by les or  the  external yet - although its been at forc for 2 months . i think that the  empirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to  both our company ' s businesses - although i ultimately didn ' t have the time  to ' explicitly ' price the jump risk - premium which i conjectured is possibly  implicit in the prices of exchange - traded electricity futures - options -  rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a  rough assessment ( with a little bit of further work , but not too much ) be  made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets .  in other words , i assumed spot jump - risk to be undiversifiable , and  essentially devoted 2 theoretical chapters to :  1 ) proving that a jump - diffusion trading model is  incomplete   ( synthesising  the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory ) -  note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with  ' term structure ' securities as in the hjm w / jumps papers of shirakawa and  das and ;  2 ) deriving an explicit risk - adjustment process for ' implementing ' the  price  of jump - risk using a jump - diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth  process ( ie . a jump - augmented production economy approach in the spirit of  cir , bates , ahn whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition  means that i have to capture mean - reversion via the futures volatility  function , and jumps are less easy to calibrate . any suggestions ?

HAM, Subject: re : gwen koepke  anne ,  thanks for contacting me about this .  as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it  today as this matter was outstanding for a long time .  i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager ,  effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus  10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager .  such promotions take place in march and i think  gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management  ( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) .  on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client  for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with  her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron .  given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer  will be quite a challenge .  gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget .  i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes .  vince  from : anne labbe / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 02 / 2001 10 : 34 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : gwen koepke  vince ,  just wanted to touch base with you . i have tried to contact maureen so that gwen ' s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested , but have not heard any response from her . would you like for me to wait until i hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title ? i just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc .  also , i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing , and your expectations during prc .  thanks ,  anne

HAM, Subject: erisk interview  vince :  you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ?  yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this  theoretical   approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day  balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the  engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic ,  social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has  written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life  sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial  valuation .  how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ?  most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign  their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it  alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or  value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying  technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in  technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often  scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur .  how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ?  you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in  effect ,  real options  . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that  real  option reduces  the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you  don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful .  what do you mean ?  often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many  companies this  risk discovery  is the most valuable part of the exercise .  real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic .  is it a practical approach to valuation ?  it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm  sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation .  how , exactly ?  the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios . this is  realistic  in that , if the project gets the green light ,  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time .  what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ?  modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we  have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to  add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back .  in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had  found it of  limited , but not zero , use  . why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today ?  it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might  have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their  perfect  model . it ' s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked  some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach .  why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when  it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ?  it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also ,  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real  options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking ,  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments .  you mean their internet investments ?  we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow .  are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach ?  yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks  are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music  business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing  leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is  good at .  is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ?  in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised ,  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number (  the value of this asset is x  ) but also from  providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the  sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking .  if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts ?  the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas ,  and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally ,  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step .  how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ?  that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the  business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from  big pharma  companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself  - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity .  rob jameson , erisk

HAM, Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera  insight  title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184  overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas  directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor  , s point of view .  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november .  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the  results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas  directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road  map to guide them .  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following :  * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all  candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although  issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved .  * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the  commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to  single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal  markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive  provides for !  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 ,  shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future  in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

HAM, Subject: ebs ' s approach to storage trading  hi ravi - -  thanks for you note . i would be very interested in a meeting to establish an  ebs - wide approach to storage . it ' s a huge opportunity .  we could expand the 2 : 30 pm friday meeting to include all interested ebs  people and discuss the topics below . could shalesh coordinate this meeting  and also coordinate the ongoing effort firm - wide ? have i omitted anything  below ?  as i see it , here are the key storage initiatives that ebs should undertake ,  and who is involved up to this point .  1 . - establish storage contract terms and pricing  who ' s involved : virawan , jean mrha beach  a . define terms for storage needed for ebs products ( mediacast ,  mediatransport , and new products )  b . define general terms for other storage contracts  2 . - establish storage pooling points ( spp )  who ' s involved : shalesh , richard reichardt , mark palmer , kara knop  who ' s needed : other designated people from bloomer and griebling groups , jim  crowder ' s group input on alliances  a . define technology needed  servers , storage devices  control software for physical delivery  b . decide optimal spp locations  at / near existing bandwidth trading pooling points  at / near existing ebs city pops  at a hosting partner location  c . engage optimal partners to create spp  ibm  ibm global services  tivioli ( storage management software )  emc  sun  compaq  existing storage portal vendors ( e . g . storage networks )  3 . - establish storage trading benchmark  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : research group  a . define unit of measure for trading contract ( e . g . , terabyte - month )  b . establish pricing mechanisms  4 . - identify ( and monetize ) storage market opportunites  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : cox ' s group , bloomer ' s group  a . storage intermediation opportunities  b . establish virtual storage portal service for ebs  ravi thuraisingham  03 / 08 / 00 11 : 00 am  to : mark s palmer / enron communications @ enron communications , jean mrha / enron  communications @ enron communications , john bloomer / enron communications @ enron  communications , richard reichardt / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : kara knop , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince kaminski , david cox / enron  communications @ enron communications , shalesh . ganjoo @ enron . com  subject : meeting for friday on storage  hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you . i  would like to discuss with you and possibly with john bloomer and richard  reichardt about the ebs research ' s role in supporting the storage market  development from the origination and trading perspective . there are several  people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what ' s my  take on our involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise .  shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort  with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and  standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly  supervising him in this effort .  shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at  one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded  storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh  to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is  our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting  jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with  request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s  role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to  coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market  assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties  involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based  on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to  suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking ,  understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data  gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the  need and as you request them .  please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner .  kind regards ,  ravi .  a bit about ebs research group  john bloomer and richard reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and  stinston gibner ' s role in ebs . i lead a team of quantitative professionals  via a group we are calling ebs research . this group reports to stinson  gibner ( vp ) and vince kaminski ( md and head of enron research ) . stinson and  vince are the original founders of enron corp research that has been charged  with model development efforts to support enron energy trading and other  enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses  ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting  and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) .  within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard  ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) ,  and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and  john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a  key role with john griebling ' s go forward network design and implementation  through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and  modeling effort .  -

HAM, Subject: steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale

HAM, Subject: re :  joe ,  i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston  for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use .  vince  joseph hrgovcic  08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject :  vince ,  i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long  term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than  the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and  that they are an  old boy ' s network  resistant to new developments , but i  don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as  the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented  phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or  so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something  even close to that will not be an easy task .  that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look  into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm  traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,  i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put  together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian  has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several  dozens of  possible  temperature forecasts every morning , which would be  calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i  would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a  far better  best guess  ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a  distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :  1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a  more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that  with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )  2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to  week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )  3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,  e . g . ,  expect the trough to recede  we could sort through the different monte  carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and  use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures  corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of  getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean  temperature - wise  4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such  models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the  traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly  match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;  although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating  month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the  visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .  just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has  written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who  worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a  simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version  of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to  implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the  technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather  consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily  ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .  they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs  on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .  i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not  sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of  enron , and not just the weather desk .  i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the  opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with  christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more  likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian  model ) .  joe

HAM, Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

HAM, Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  friday , december 15  1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .  ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found  an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy  and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso  are to be agreed to by the parties .  if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson  will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable .  the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered  to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the  iso ,  acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators .   [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s  seriously flawed  market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either  over - reached  or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh  soft cap   proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a   comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures  must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh  price benchmark  for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a  missed  opportunity  to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order (  balanced and considerate  ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh  soft cap  proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly   walked the line  by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or  deregulation  did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .
HAM, Subject: alex tartakovski  as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski  in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able  to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and  my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office .  i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is  the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly  out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight ,  but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him  donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home  number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 .  by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to  fill in some of the  vacants  in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of  specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 )  coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 )  modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he  has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at  building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because  portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness  of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating  these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between   my  group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the  expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are  being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava  and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research .  over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new  electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i  would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so  i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave

HAM, Subject: re : option p & l  brad ,  i was extreamly busy yesterday . sorry for answing your question till now .  although i am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma , this is what i  think the system is doing :  curve shift = today ' s price - yesterady ' s price  p / l due to curve shift = today ' s market value using today ' s price curve ( with  everything esle the same as yesterday ' s ) - yesterday ' s market value using  yesterday ' s price curve .  so p / l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order  terms .  we then use theoretical gamma ( meaning option model gamma : 0 . 5 * gamma * ( price  change ) 2 ) for gamma contribution and ? define delta = curve shift - theoretical gamma . ? ? therefore , the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the delta change , ? especially when you have big price change due to higher order contribution . ? ? let me know your thoughts on this . ? ? ? best wishes , ? ? zimin ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? brad horn 10 / 12 / 2000 07 : 11 am ? ? to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect ? cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vladimir gorny / hou / ect @ ect , robert ? shiring / hou / ect @ ect , jay knoblauh / hou / ect @ ect ? subject : option p & l ? ? gentleman : ? the erms system , as you know , has an excellent capability for ? decomposing option p & l into the following components : ? ? new deals ? curve shift ? gamma ? vega ? theta ? rho ? drift ? 2 nd order adjustments ? ? what i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars . ? the unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position ? is being associated with specific prices . these prices are the effective buy ? or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position . ? ? stated differently , the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price ? variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma ' s ? standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs . this is something i dont ? understand . to date , inquiries to the risk management accounting group has ? further revealed that the gamma component of p & l is not well understood . ? ? this is what concerns me : bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures ( nymex ? and gas daily ) . both books dynamically hedged its positions during ? yesterdays large price move and , through anticipitory hedging in advance or ? during the large price move , secured sufficient coverage to neutralize ? expected changes in delta . however , our p & l from our underlying position did ? not offset our gamma p & l . consequently , i have to ask why ? im hoping that a ? brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which ? will better guide our hedging decisions . ? ? any help is appreciated ? ?

HAM, Subject: re : natural gas storage item  vince -  something very interesting about natural gas storage ( from the class ) .  the industry is rapidly adopting what are called  operational balancing  agreements ,  where the pipeline contracts with the producers and ldc ' s  ( public utilities ) to handle all  imbalances  in shipping , namely all  production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise . shippers then  always  book  what is scheduled to happen , and not what actually happens .  the end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions  are used to smooth out not only weekday - weekend seasonal patterns ( the  well - known  parking  ) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well .  cutting to the chase , storage facilities in producing regions are operated to  insure the integrity of the pipeline system , and estimated marketed  production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline ' s  receipt meter than is production less local storage .  clayton

however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .

HAM, Subject: discount rates and risk capital  dear vince :  i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on  determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat  surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of  that addresses these issues .  very briefly ,  1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk  capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate .  2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and  how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its  value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital  changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration  and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s  opportunity cost of capital .  3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify  some of the issues that i have raised .  please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat  confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this .  please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you .  regards ,  sheridan  - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu

HAM, Subject: var for cob 28 th july 2000  hi all ,  i have run the var model for the positions at close fo business 28 th of july .  the model is attached below .  as a summary the results are as follows :  and as a comparison the previous days figures were :  this shows some increase in var for aluminium , copper and lead . the prices  for gold and cocoa beans have not been updated  as we still do not have a live feed to bloomberg / reuters . i will be working  on this with cantekin and andreas should also be able to  provide some more historical data .  also , after having a discussion with andreas here in london we should  probably reduce the vol we are using for tc - we are taking the cu price  vol as a proxy which is a too high . however , assuming the the other  assumptions we have made around the tc ( ie simulating a parallel shift in  the curve and  including no term structure to the price curve ) the vol estimate is a  conservative one .  cheers  kirstee

HAM, Subject: calculating bid - ask prices  this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie ' s gross box office receipt . rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback .  i think the idea ( see below ) might be applicable to other parts of enron . we can call it  dynamic bid - ask price process  .  in fact , we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time . the final ( clearing ) bid and ask prices are just the last  tentative  price shown to the public before the bidding period ends . ( so the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish . )  i think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via enrononline . com .  - chonawee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron on 04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 48 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  chonawee supatgiat  04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 40 pm  to : richard dimichele / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron @ enron , cynthia harkness / enron communications @ enron communications , greg wolfe / hou / ect @ ect , james ginty / enron communications @ enron communications , jim fallon / enron communications @ enron communications , kelly kimberly / enron communications @ enron communications , kevin howard / enron communications @ enron communications , key kasravi / enron communications @ enron communications , kristin albrecht / enron communications @ enron communications , kristina mordaunt / enron communications @ enron communications , martin lin / contractor / enron communications @ enron communications , paul racicot / enron communications @ enron communications , zachary mccarroll / enron communications @ enron communications , martin lin / contractor / enron communications @ enron communications  subject : calculating bid - ask prices  i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it . otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market , we may have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and we may end up taking some positions . you know , as russ and martin pointed out , we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily .  one way to ensure the balance of the bid - ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid - ask prices front end . each week , we have a trading period . during the period , instead of posting bid - ask prices , we post  tentative  bid - ask prices , then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price . these  tentative  bid - ask prices get updated and are shown to the public . of course , customers can revise / withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period . at the end of the period , we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices . the seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price . the buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price . next week , we repeat the same process .  this way , we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don ' t take any position at all . we make profit from those bid - ask spread . we don ' t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders ' trading because we don ' t have to take any position . let the market be the one who decides the price .  if we maintain our net position as zero , at the end , when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications , our customers with open long / short positions are perfectly matched . using the mark - to - market charge can reduce credit risk .  thanks ,  - chonawee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chonawee supatgiat / corp / enron on 04 / 24 / 2001 07 : 24 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  chonawee supatgiat  04 / 20 / 2001 04 : 31 pm  to : richard dimichele / enron communications @ enron communications , key kasravi / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : martin lin / contractor / enron communications @ enron communications  subject : some more input  hi rich and key ,  again i think your idea is very good . i think that we , as a market maker , can reduce our credit risk ( risk of default ) if we do the  mark - to - market  charging . that is , each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt , we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market . this way , we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money .  in the last paragraph , i think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself ( i . e . , if there are lots of buyers , our offer price should go up . )  we can offer other derivative products such as options as well .  - chonawee

HAM, Subject: houston research opportunity  dear vince i would like to make  the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one - year assignment working  with tanya , and then re - evaluate the situation at the end of the year in  terms a new role for me in houston thereafter , subject to mutual agreement .  the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re - joining enron  corp is too dramatic and requires me to  burn bridges  and my return to enron  europe would be difficult . also , i would lose the valuable support  structures available to me in london . the amount of any fixed costs  ( flights , modest cargo , a few months of mortgage carrying cost ) are entirely  reasonable , not excessive given my single status and not so great that they  justify making the contract a three year ( local ) one .  i would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1 / 2 years solid experience &  value - added at enron europe , the value of several million pounds i have  identified & justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an   excellent  rating ( my fourth making my 3 1 / 2 yr average rating also   excellent  ) , i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal ( i . e . my  existing enron europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one - off  allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses ) .  regards & thanks again for the opportunity ,  anjam  x 35383

HAM, Subject: organizational changes  changes in enron ' s business require us to reevaluate how we approach the  engineering and construction function within enron . specifically , enron  energy services ' ( ees ) business has grown dramatically and that requires  considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to  develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers .  additionally , in light of enron ' s continued emphasis on increasing our return  on invested capital , we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction  projects around the world . historically , these projects have been a primary  focus of eecc ' s activities . consequently we are making the following  organizational changes concerning eecc :  eecc ' s pipeline construction group , led by jerry martin , will become part of  enron transportation services .  nepco will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant  construction services to enron entities and third parties .  the remainder of eecc will become part of ees . larry izzo will report to the  ees office of the chairman .  these changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth  opportunities within enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our  employees . please join us in supporting and implementing these changes .

HAM, Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees  to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order  to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for  at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south  america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to  the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the  transition , jim will join ees .  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale  businesses and the commercial support functions :  enron net works  louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and  ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .  enron americas  concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for  operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,  marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report  into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility  for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south  america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief  operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron  americas .  enron europe  the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia  and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john  sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .  enron global markets  enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and  ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have  responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the  exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to  enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the  commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,  equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .  enron industrial markets  enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,  president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .  commercial support for ews  the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,  the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in  the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more  efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across  ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these  newly defined roles are as follows :  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office  operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice  president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated  services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the  wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these  services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will  continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible  for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .  legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .  regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a  regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in  the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all  european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue  to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions  and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief  of staff .  public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional  basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,  enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue  in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler  will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as  well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .  these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship  to mark palmer , vice president of communications .  business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover  ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .  attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale  services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization  continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .  enron global exploration and production  and enron wind  as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments  around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to  egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff  baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron  wind , will report to cliff .  corporate staff  we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,  government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in  that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and  community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and  chief of staff .  committee structure  in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s  growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our  business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to  be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and  the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be  drawing on this group to lead company -

HAM, Subject: re : hdaf seminar topics  folks :  i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for  wednesday ,  december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from  3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me  know by  day ' s end .  professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston  will start  with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of  his work  and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .  professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for  audiovisual  or other equipment .  this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the  subject of our meeting :  [ . . . ] topics to  be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :  1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data  extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital  data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential  operators to digital data , etc . )  2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear  partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which  existing methods encounter stability problems .  there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the  hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a  single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting  we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust  for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which  you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

HAM, Subject: possible rtp conference  dear mr . kaminski :  thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would  like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .  as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing  power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it  seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the   forgotten resource  in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a  lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many  researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was  asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give  it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by  policymakers .  frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a  useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major  sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron  that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,  it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the  conference is widely circulated among key government groups .  i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and  recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to  participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of  providing funding for this effort .  thank you ,  hill huntington  - retail notes . rtf  hillard g . huntington  emf - an international forum on  energy and environmental markets voice : ( 650 ) 723 - 1050  408 terman center fax : ( 650 ) 725 - 5362  stanford university email : hillh @ stanford . edu  stanford , ca 94305 - 4026  emf website : http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / emf /

HAM, Subject: mg metals : additional areas to look at  dear lloyd & richard ,  i have been discussing with eric gadd about two particular areas of concern  that will affect the london research group . i believe there are a number of  issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk  management and quantitative analysis perspective , and i have put together a  ( by no means exhaustive ) list : -  i ) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective ( e . g . their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add - ins )  ii ) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our var system ( we will require historical data  for this ) . i am sure bjorn will be looking to the research group to assist  in this matter .  iii ) ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  these tasks will involve a significant degree of cross - communication with  relevant contacts within mg metals , and so i look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - i hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development , so please do not hesitate to  involve me .  best regards ,  anjam ahmad  research  x 35383

HAM, Subject: alp proposal  carrie ,  i am sending you , as promised , the draft of my proposal . please , let me know  if it meets your requirements . i shall be glad to revise it and send you the  final version .  vince kaminski  * * * * * * * * * *  one of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last year  was proliferation of electronic , internet based , trading platforms for  wholesale markets and for retail operations . websites such as  www . houstonstreet . com and www . altranet . com provide facilities for matching  buyers and sellers . the website operated by enron corp . ( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _

HAM, Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .

HAM, Subject: japanese power market  another article i thought you might find interesting .  regards ,  eugenio  review of energy policies kicks off  asahi shimbun  april 25 , 2000  a government advisory panel on monday embarked on a  comprehensive review of energy - related policies .  ` ` we want to come up with feasible policies and at the  same time clearly present reasons for those policies , ' '  yoichi kaya , a professor emeritus at the university of  tokyo , told a meeting of the coordination subcommittee  under the advisory committee for energy , an advisory  panel to minister of international trade and industry  takashi fukaya . kaya chairs the subcommittee .  the nuclear development policy , including the  government ' s goal for building new nuclear power plants ,  is expected to be a focus of the discussions .  a spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of  plants increasingly difficult , and the nation ' s power  suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power  plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20  to 13 .  the subcommittee , set up for the first time in about 10  years , is made up of about 30 members , and members of  anti - nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been  included for the first time .  some members told monday ' s meeting that the  government must stop taking the nuclear development  policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility  of introducing renewable energy , such as wind and solar  power .  also on the agenda will be energy saving measures .  energy consumption in the residential and commercial  sector , made up of homes and offices , and in the  transportation sector , which includes cars and trucks , has  almost doubled over the past 25 years .  at monday ' s meeting , many members stressed the need  to change public consciousness toward the use of  energy .  miti plans to present studies on how life would be  affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as  automatically turning off air conditioners at certain  temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle .

HAM, Subject: re : eol pricing algorithm  hi bob ,  some comments :  1 . you request enron position after successful market order , but not after  limit order - - you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent .  i am not clear on how you would use enron position . it is possible that the  trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and  offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position , but this  target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere , and  without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron  position to . of course , enron position may still provide some insights .  2 . you request bid - mid - ask prices for each trade - - - given that a successful  trade may execute later than time of order ( especially for limit orders ) ,  would you need the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over this time interval  ( time of order to time of execution ) ? also , for failed trades , you may need  the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over the time interval from time of  order to time of rejection . this again mainly applies to limit orders , as  the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed  of execution ( something to check ) .  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : lee , bob  sent : monday , april 23 , 2001 8 : 33 am  to : kaminski , vince ; shanbhogue , vasant ; barkley , tom  cc : lu , zimin ; huang , alex ; gibner , stinson  subject : eol pricing algorithm  a draft data request for eol data we would use to study p & l patterns for the   george  pricing algorithm is attached for your review .  i would like to send this to andy zipper and jay webb this afternoon .  bob  >

HAM, Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an   under hire .  he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive  promotion .   at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as  professional meteorologist .  in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a  new - hire  to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

HAM, Subject: sr . director position  vince : as you requested , i have obtained some information from norma  relating to the salary parameters of the sr . director position . the minimum  salary is $ 83 , 800 , and the maximum is $ 168 , 000 ( huge range , isn ' t it ? ) .  however , norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention : the  lowest salary of a vp in your group is currently $ 140 , 000 , and the average  director ' s salary in your group is $ 120 , 000 . those numbers narrow the  range considerably . of course , there is no equity issue since there is no  other senior director in your group .  hope this information helps ,  molly

HAM, Subject: fund raising for mit sloan school  dear vince ,  please find the following description of the program that i would like to  raise additional funding for . i will follow up today with a phone call to  answer any questions you may have .  as always we appreciate your time and support .  thanks ,  jozef  the eastern european students at mit sloan school of management are  preparing an eastern european week to be held in march 2001 . the one - week  long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries  that are going through the post communist transformation . as you well know ,  eastern europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies .  unfortunately , it also presents many obstacles that make most of the  opportunities difficult to capture .  because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles ,  we want to bring the eastern european experience to mit sloan school of  management . familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries  is only one step toward reforming eastern europe , but we believe it is  worth our time and effort .  during the week , we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the  business environment in eastern europe . we want to emphasize especially  the success stories from eastern europe . such companies as enron ,  volkswagen , exxonmobil , gm , and ge have entered the eastern european market  and show commitment to stay in it . in at least one panel discussion with  academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know  that eastern europe is a real place for business .  in addition to the educational activities , we are preparing number of  cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area .  the scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to  raise from our sponsors . in return , we plan to advertise our sponsors in  every activity we will do . we will make banners and any other appropriate  advertising as desired by the sponsor . should a sponsor be willing to send  a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech / lecture we would  appreciate the enrichment to our program .  the advertising will reach nearly 700 sloan students and faculty . in  addition , the advertising will reach all newly admitted students , as they  will visit our campus for the admit day ( an official program to sell our  school to the admitted students ) .

HAM, Subject: re : full version  i read the chapter . generally ,  i like it , and find it non - controversial  and well written . of course , this is  a huge topic and there are things  that you haven ' t discussed .  i thought the amount of attention  paid to ols and mle estimation  was a bit overboard , given that you  didn ' t really exploit it in your  results . if you were to state  the likelihood function for  the garch model , it might justify  the amount of attention to  gave to estimation for  simple iid processes , which could then  be thought of as a simple lead - in  and intuition builder to  the more interesting models that  you do actually use .  by the way , in your discussion of  smiles , you discuss fat tails  extensively . at least for equity markets ,  while fat tails contribute , they don ' t do very  much at all compared to the effect  of risk premia , which you allude to briefly ,  using supply - demand language , at the  end of that section .  for the impact of risk premia , see  jun pan ' s paper , which is available  from her web page . but she covers  only sp 500 , ( as do most studies ) ,  and your markets are obviously much different .  the chapter will be a good service to your readers !  best , darrell  > x - lotus - fromdomain : ect  > from :  vince j kaminski   > to : darrell duffie  > cc :  grant masson  ,  vince j kaminski   > date : wed , 16 aug 2000 16 : 37 : 53 - 0500  > subject : re : full version  > mime - version : 1 . 0  > content - disposition : inline  > x - uidl : 00453 eda 98 c 82 d 709 e 6123 af 537 e 4 f 63  > x - keywords :  >  >  >  > darrell ,  >  > thanks a lot . i really appreciate it . the text is below our usual  > standards but we are completely swamped with work here .  >  > vince  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  > darrell duffie on 08 / 15 / 2000 04 : 54 : 23 pm  >  > please respond to darrell duffie  >  > to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  > cc :  > subject : re : full version  >  >  > i ' ll have a look !  >  > i haven ' t much time , but can certainly  > get you a quick reaction , at least !  >  > best , darrell  >  >  > > x - lotus - fromdomain : ect  > > from :  vince j kaminski   > > to : duffie @ stanford . edu  > > date : thu , 10 aug 2000 14 : 04 : 47 - 0500  > > subject : full version  > > mime - version : 1 . 0  > > content - disposition : inline  > > x - uidl : 9 fef 7462 afa 5 d 4 ee 6 co 4 c 9 co 2 df 71 b 25  > > x - keywords :  > >  > >  > >  > > darrell ,  > >  > > grant just alerted me that i sent you only part of the text .  > >  > > here is the full chapter with an aged version of gran ' t part .  > > what i sent you represents an update of his contribution .  > >  > > sorry for that .  > >  > > vince  > >  > > ( see attached file : volo 720 . doc )  >  > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  > darrell duffie  > mail gsb stanford ca 94305 - 5015 usa  > phone 650 723 1976  > fax 650 725 7979  > email duffie @ stanford . edu  > web http : / / www . stanford . edu / ~ duffie /  > _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  darrell duffie  mail gsb stanford ca 94305 - 5015 usa  phone 650 723 1976  fax 650 725 7979  email duffie @ stanford . edu  web http : / / www . stanford . edu / ~ duffie /

' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just  mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how  should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .  in short  - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes  - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the  current , best - effort internet .  - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is  pricing substitute products on the internet  , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .

HAM, Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would  double dip  into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .

HAM, Subject: introduction  vince :  as way of introduction , i wanted to write a bit about mars inc . and then  about cds ,  the unit i head . mars is a private company , considered to be the largest  privately owned  manufacturing company in the world . mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its  finances ,  so the best i could do is refer to forbes ' estimate of $ 15 billion annual  revenue and  to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 - 12 % . mars is in the  business of  manufacturing confectionery ( m & m , dove bar , skittles , twix , - all ( r ) )  food ( uncle ben rice ( r ) ) pet food ( pedigree , whiskas waltham ( r ) ) and other  products .  mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that  emphasizes the  long term goals of the company . part of the philosophy is to look for win - win  solutions with  its suppliers , customers and partners .  as can be understood from the nature of the company , a large chunk of its  expenses  goes towards purchasing commodity like products , and hence the history of  researching  those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand  ( people  eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer ) .  cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very  successful ,  with an envious track record , in helping mars get a competitive advantage in  these arenas .  cds is a global group ( in 4 countries across two continents ) which supports  the  purchasing  function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas . it is a  multidiscipline and  multinational team with a lot to offer .  not having a ready access to the energy markets , and with a risk profile based  on  manufacturing expertise , mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this  area .  enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to  talk to .  in talking to enron , we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to  anything  at this point , and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to  pursue the opportunity  we discussed in the future .  i am looking forward to our video conference call .  kind regards ,  avi  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  avi i . hauser phd mba  cds director  100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 - 1383  + 1 973 691 3664 ( office )  + 1 973 347 8189 ( fax )  + 1 973 727 3622 ( car + slow paging )  hauser @ cdsusa . com

HAM, Subject: altos na gas model  kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term  natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america  should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,  in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .  pipeline grid .  as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale  nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and  one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the  one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription  price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other  details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still  need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test .  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be  responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in  ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key  role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team .  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the   affiliate  issues ) .  let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .  jng
