<!--"Excuse me mam but do I know you?". "No sir you don't" replied Alice. H=
eart pounding palms sweating she was a wreck. Born a princess in March 1997=
 but now just a regular Joe she had done the unthinkable. Daughter to the k=
ing and queen of Southern Nigeria she was born into wealth. From having her=
 very own chauffeur to three security cars to ensure her safety at all time=
s. But these 23 years were anything but all rosy. In the kingdom at 14 year=
s of age, girls were normally introduced to the topic of being someone's wi=
fe and taught how to treat a man. Alice took the class but found herself wa=
iting anxiously for the kingdom's elders(teachers) to get to "How to be you=
rself". They never got to that and so she took it upon herself to question =
her mother about it.=20
"Mom how do you do it?" She enquired. "I'm all ears my darling " the mother=
 replied. "How do you ensure that you retain the core you while being the q=
ueen"? Alice proceeded. Hopeful for an enlightening response disappointment=
 filled her face when her mother opened her mouth. "I don't need to retain =
the core me. Your father's commands, wishes and desires are my core and I l=
ive solely to serve them". Not sure how to respond to that Alice took to pl=
aying tennis to stop herself from overthinking it. On the tennis court she =
found herself replaying her mother's words in her head over and over. She c=
ouldn't put her finger on why what she said disturbed her all she knew was =
that it did. At a dead end she reached out to her father. King Asufah was a=
 busy man but managed to lend her an ear for a short while before bursting =
out of the room. "Father I'm a bit lost and would appreciate your guidance =
at the moment. " She started the conversation. "I'm all ears my darling." H=
e went. "Could you kindly tell me what a woman is" She proceeded. "hahaha! =
Village elders not teaching you enough is it? Well a woman is one with a hu=
sband, one who obeys and ensures that her husband's dreams and vision are r=
ealised." King Asufah replied. "What about her dreams father?". "My dreams =
are her dreams" The King said. Mental paralysis took over her (Alice) body =
and she found herself in a spot she knew she had to get out of. At 15 the t=
opic of arranged marriages was introduced and she learned that in about thr=
ee years she was to be someone's wife. She planned on being many things but=
 being someone's wife and "dream adopter" was not on her list. What she did=
n't know was that her father was already arranging her marriage so as to sw=
eeten the negotiations for an open trade route between his kingdom and its =
neighbour. She continued living her life in the dark until Oneday when she =
was told that she on her eighteenth birthday would be married off to the Pr=
ince of Agaga(A state in just outside Southern Nigeria). She outright refus=
ed to do so which was considered disrespectful by most elders involved with=
 the royal buffoonery. "How could she refuse to execute an order from the k=
ing when her mother does so elegantly?" Some elders rhetorically enquired t=
o themselves.=20
Ameli (The king's trusted cook) was the only one in the palace Alice was fr=
ee around. "I don't want to marry someone I don't love under the belief tha=
t I'll learn to do so with time under my father's fist. I want a life of my=
 own where I am free to follow my heart and pursue my dreams. Is that too m=
uch for everyone to comprehend?". Poor Ameli had to give a suitable answer =
and so she went " It's easy to comprehend. The problem is that once a bad t=
hing is done generation after generation it starts appearing like it's the =
right thing to do and anything other than doing it is considered disrespect=
ing the culture. Then they put a billion dollar trust fund that you can onl=
y access when you get married to the chosen partner aside for you."=20
Learning that there was a billion dollars somewhere with her name on it but=
 marriage approved by her father was the only way to get to it annoyed her.=
 Just before her eighteenth birthday she decided to take the kingdom to cou=
rt for practicing what she referred to as a "deliberate attempt to steal wo=
mens lives and turn them into trophies". Her father was so fired up and uns=
urprisingly so was her mother. On her eighteenth birthday court proceedings=
 began and it's safe to say that it was an overly eventful day because the =
royal family of Agaga was also in attendance. They however were not there f=
or the court proceedings but to marry their son off. Anything other than do=
ing what was "right" for generations was disrespecting the culture and they=
 were not about to allow that to happen. Court or no court the wedding had =
to go on. Alice obviously refused and KING Asufah was given a week to get h=
er daughter right by the Agaga kingdom. This further strengthened Alice's c=
ase. In the following days her father's lawyers brought forward her sisters=
' marriages to try demonstrate that what King Asufah was doing was empoweri=
ng women as her daughters instantly became billionaires upon marriage. Howe=
ver that information was interpreted as a way to force the kids into marria=
ge by the king...helping his case in no way. The day came when Alice had to=
 take to the box and so she did. "I don't want to be a woman because I've b=
een made to understand that she has no mind of her own but is merely an ext=
ension of her husband's. I don't want to get married because I've been made=
 to understand that in marriage the woman follows the husband's orders blin=
dly. I don't want to be an overnight billionaire because then I'd lose myse=
lf. Last but not least...I don't want to be my parent's child anymore nor t=
o be affiliated with their Kingdom and its riches in any way. Thank you." T=
he court erupted with utter silence and the Case was respectfully handed to=
 Alice. The king was forced to change the laws and Alice had officially dis=
owned her parents and successfully avoided being an overnight billionaire.=
=20
Two years later at twenty years old, in tracksuits and sneakers she met a m=
an who asked her " Excuse me mam but do I know you?". Her reaction was swea=
ty as she thought the man was one of her disowned father's lackeys sent to =
harm her. Only to find out that the man worked in the same building as she =
did but they rarely came across each other. Three years later they are enga=
ged and going strong by the day.-->

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The last second of Cassie Maclay?s lif=
e was cold, but filled with wonder. The sky was gorgeous, painted in the hu=
es of the residual sunset that hadn?t heard the news that the sun had alrea=
dy imploded, or vanished, or whatever had happened, and she held her baby b=
rother?s forearm with a sort of anxious delight. It was inevitable, as inev=
itable as the movements of the stars. What was there to be done? She barely=
 understood how the sun works, much less how she could get it to pop back i=
nto existence. Astronomy was beautiful, sure, but utterly incomprehensible.=
 Even then, she looked up at the stars with a sorrowed bemusement. It?d bee=
n a rough eleven years, but it had been what it was and nothing more. Human=
s could so rarely even begin to understand the inevitable, but Cassie had m=
uch practice. Her little brother giggled at a nearby firefly just before th=
eir blood instantly froze over and their veins split with the new volume, a=
nd it was such a miraculous sound. All around the world, if she tried, she =
could hear the giggling children, and the fighting, and the crying. Maybe i=
t was a natural end for the Earth. At least it would be over in an instant.=
&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">A minute before the end of the world, =
Cassie Maclay had taken her little brother into the garage so they could gr=
ab the folding chairs that their parents used to tailgate sometimes. Her br=
other was only four, so he drowned in the chair when he was done setting it=
 up, bunching his legs up to sit cross-legged while his ham-hands closed ar=
ound the apple juice she?d snuck from the fridge. If the world would have k=
ept going, she would have gotten yelled out when they found out about it. W=
hen she was younger, and her range was still on Earth, Cassie had been over=
whelmed by the amount of hunger that people expressed, every moment of ever=
y day, and she?d tried to take food from her own fridge to find them and fe=
ed them, so she wouldn?t hear them anymore. Her parents hadn?t believed her=
-- they never believed her. She propped her own chair next to her brothers =
and sat down to look at the stars.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Two minutes before the end of the worl=
d, Cassie Maclay snuck into her little brother?s room, where he?d already b=
een put to sleep even though it was only seven. His room was decorated with=
 all the old vestiges of hers-- all the old stuffed animals and toy trucks =
her mother had decided she was too old for when her brother was born. Just =
because Cassie had heard the conversation her mother had had with her fathe=
r a week earlier didn?t mean she wasn?t sad when her toys were all rounded =
up in a trash bag for the new baby. She woke her brother up quietly, and to=
ld him she had something to show him but they had to be quiet. They crept d=
ownstairs together, walking near the walls and furniture on their way to th=
e garage. Despite the best efforts of their parents, Cassie?d always been c=
lose to her little brother, who loved the way she could catch anything he t=
hrew into the air.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Three minutes before the end of the wo=
rld, Cassie Maclay quickly texted her old friends. They hadn?t really been =
her friends as much as the children of her mother?s friends. Cassie?s power=
, congenital and aggressive, was to have an inherent knowledge of everythin=
g that would happen or was happening, give or take about ten minutes into t=
he future. She hadn?t been able to keep up a conversation since she was awa=
re of what everyone would say a few minutes in advance and she was always s=
o horribly distracted by the thoughts swirling around the world and the dis=
tant echoes of a million asteroids crashing into one another and into more =
and more distant planets. Cassie texted them anyway, just to tell them that=
 she?d heard it was supposed to be a beautiful sunset today.&nbsp;</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Four and five minutes before the end o=
f the world, Cassie Maclay had frantically been searching ?What happens whe=
n the sun dies? on her mother?s iPad, borrowed from the living room with no=
 intention of returning it. Leading experts estimated that, in the event th=
e sun miraculously disappeared or turned off somehow, it would take a week =
for the Earth to cool off to zero degrees fahrenheit. That estimate, accord=
ing to Cassie?s visions swarming her head, was incorrect. She kept checking=
 anyway, even though she knew nothing would change. Nothing ever changed fr=
om the way she saw it in her head, even if what she saw made no scientific =
sense. The internet told her nothing useful, like she knew it wouldn?t. She=
 knew that, whether she liked it or not, whether it was scientifically prov=
en or not, in five and then four minutes, Earth would finally feel the effe=
cts of the sun going out all at once. It wouldn?t be a painful death, altho=
ugh their frozen corpses with their burst veins and crystal eyes would be g=
ross to behold. Cassie related it to how bees weren?t supposed to fly accor=
ding to physics, and yet they did anyway. Sometimes the inexplicable happen=
ed, even to physics.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Six minutes before the end of the worl=
d, Cassie Maclay did a short version of the breathing exercises that a well=
-meaning school psychologist had taught her in the fourth grade, believing =
her explanation of being able to hear and see everything that was presentan=
tly happening or that would soon happen in the universe to be a delusion of=
 grandeur brought on by anxiety. Cassie thought about the psychologist fond=
ly-- the breathing exercises really did help. It was so hard, sometimes, to=
 only concentrate on the present she was experiencing and not hear the snor=
es of the elderly in Thailand and the squeaking of a newborn seal in Antarc=
tica and the electric storms of the Northern pole of Saturn. The worked thi=
s time, too, helping her gather her presence into what she was actively exp=
eriencing, and once she?d done that, helping her see ahead to the next six =
minutes. The world was ending whether she liked it or not, so where would s=
he like to be? She decided on her backyard, with her brother. It would be n=
ice to die instantly with somebody who loved her, Cassie thought.&nbsp;</sp=
an></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Seven minutes before the end of the wo=
rld, Cassie Maclay?s mother yelled at her for audibly crying. Cassie didn?t=
 bother to try and explain-- nobody ever believed her anyway. She?d spent t=
he next couple trying to figure out exactly when the end would be; she?d se=
en the sun turn off a minute ago in real time, but her foresight was a litt=
le harder to pinpoint. There was still so much she wanted to do, but the fu=
ture was inevitable, and for the first time in Cassie?s life, she couldn?t =
see anything beyond the next seven minutes, no matter how hard she tried.&n=
bsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Eight minutes before the end of the wo=
rld, Cassie Maclay watched in real-time and horror as the sun disappeared f=
rom the solar system, leaving nothing behind but the blank emptiness of spa=
ce. It vanished at the precise same instant that Cassie?s little brother tw=
itched his foot in his sleep, and her old school psychologist cracked her k=
nuckles from the last time and the girl who?d invited her to her third grad=
e birthday sleepover out of obligation put on a lipstick that was aggressiv=
ely pink and an asteroid passed far too close to Rasalhague in the Ophiuchu=
s constellation for its own good and for a second, like every second of Cas=
sie Maclay?s life, she was so aware of time and space and how how everyone =
on the planet was connected in ways they never imagined or understood. She =
lay back on her bed, in her town, in her state, in her country, and let our=
 star?s legacy die like the Earth soon would, and tried, for a second, to i=
gnore the inevitable and be as ignorant to the future as everyone in her to=
wn and state and country and you are doing right now.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I know when I?ll die. When I was ten, =
a drunk man handed me a bit of paper. I know what you?re thinking. I was th=
inking the same thing. I was never one to be rude to strangers though and t=
o and the piece of paper he handed me was beautiful. Some things have an ai=
r of importance. The letter I was given was one of them. It looked hundreds=
 of years old that day and was written in the most incredible calligraphy.<=
/span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It told me five things; the date of my=
 first seizure, the day I?d meet my wife, the day I?d go into a coma, the d=
ay I?d wake up and the day I?ll die.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">For four years after receiving the wei=
rd fortune letter from the drunk it was just an odd thing I had framed on m=
y wall. Yes, I know that?s weird, but my friends thought it was cool as wel=
l.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Then when I was fourteen and watching =
television with my best friend, Stargate SG1 if you must know, I had my fir=
st seizure. As it turns out it was the same day the letter had predicted. S=
omething about a group of American soldiers finding a dormant alien colony =
ship was too much was too much for my brain during puberty. Don?t read anyt=
hing into that, I really like sci-fi, but not that much.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">My friend had to untangle me from the =
wire for my CD player. Yes, I?m that old. My dad took him home while I went=
 to hospital in an ambulance with my mum, not that important now.</span></p=
>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">When I got home from the hospital havi=
ng had a blood sample taken, I hate needles, I looked at the bit of paper o=
n the wall and realised the first prediction had come true. That should hav=
e been scary, especially since the next entries in the prophecy of drunk No=
stradamus were life changing wife meeting, coma, recovery and death, but no=
</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was oddly reassuring to have it in =
writing that I would recover, meet a nice girl and live a long life. Did I =
mention that I?m going to live to ninety-seven years old? For my family par=
ticularly that is doing well.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The night of the second prediction the=
re was a house party with a load of people at my high school. The letter sa=
id I would meet my wife. I think there was fine print written in invisible =
ink.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Everyone was drinking apart from the g=
irl who showed up already unconscious from drinking before the party, is th=
ere always one of those? One girl sat on my lap in a dark room asking me wh=
at shampoo I used and playing with my hair. I felt awkward both because the=
 girl?s boyfriend was outside the door having a weirdly non-intrusive meltd=
own and because until I moved out of my parent?s house, I was still using t=
he same baby shampoo my mum had been buying since it was age appropriate.</=
span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was at that party I found out the g=
irls who knew me from primary school called me Rock Boy because I had colle=
cted gemstones, not cool. I saw a girl asleep on a couch wake up, throw up =
and then fall asleep in it again. It might be safe to say that no one left =
that party with their dignity.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">After one of the girls returned from a=
 detour with a boy denying anything happened despite her top being inside o=
ut, I tried to outdrink some older kids despite being a small bottle of vod=
ka ahead of them. I half remember being sent home from the party after proj=
ectile vomiting.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I?m not tea total but I?ve never had v=
odka since. I think alcohol played the part of villain for almost everyone =
that went to that party. I?m single, unmarried and hoping my future wife ne=
ither took part in nor witnessed anything to do with vomit that night.</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It?s safe to say my stock in dignity w=
ent up after high school. Art school was my place. Finally drawing on the f=
urniture was not only acceptable but expected. I had gone hoping to become =
a world-famous painter. It turned out I was not amenable to the task of pai=
nting collections of plants and fruit in baskets. I?d done that in high sch=
ool, boring.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">When I was told not to join painting b=
ecause I painted the still life collection exploding as the backdrop was in=
vaded by jungle, I was told painting probably wasn?t for me. There were of =
course other little things. Artistic license was supposed to be used at the=
 discretion of the first-year tutors. They laughed when I drew a Greek city=
 in the background of one nude model instead of the rest of the class. They=
 didn?t laugh as much during the next nude drawing session when I was runni=
ng out of time after finishing the sketch of the model and decided to have =
her sitting at the bus stop outside instead.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I met a girl at a club, woke up at her=
 place the next morning and spent the next three years in a very unstable r=
elationship. During that time, I was studying photography instead of painti=
ng, layering images over each other for a haunting but easy to achieve aest=
hetic.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I graduated from art school and the th=
ree-year relationship, two loving relationships over.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">After starting a terrible job cleaning=
 hotel rooms, I was invited to a reunion of old friends organised by the sa=
me friend who saved me from a rogue CD player cable years before. As always=
, he had a girlfriend. As always, I was the awkward one.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It?s hard to underdress for a party he=
ld in a barn but I managed it. Everyone else looked like a fashion advert, =
not me. People remembered Rock Boy despite my insistence that I don?t colle=
ct fossils and geodes anymore. I beat a few people at beer pong because I?m=
 competitive instead being social.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I should probably explain that the peo=
ple who owned the barn ran a stable for racehorses and had a lot of money. =
The barn had a better sound system than most night clubs. I was in a lot of=
 reunion photos doing my classic pose which I like to call ?rabbit in the h=
eadlights.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Some of the building materials from th=
e most recent remodelling had been piled up in the car park. After drinks e=
veryone decided those boards and planks would look better on fire. I agreed=
 It was also our opinion, as drunks, that jumping through the flames was a=
 good idea.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was all fine until it wasn?t. We we=
re jumping through the flames without issues for two hours as the wood burn=
t low. Naturally as the wooden boards transitioned into ash they moved, spr=
eading out. During that transition us drunken idiots were growing in confid=
ence. We?d made several successful jumps each. It had to be me to end the w=
inning streak.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Nails are a commonly used component in=
 building and some of the planks from the fire still had theirs. After many=
 successful leaps I stood on one. It went straight through the sole of my w=
hite trainers.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I know what you?re thinking now, why w=
hite trainers? The answer is I thought they?d look good with the blood pour=
ing out of the sole of my foot. I wasn?t wrong.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The white trainers are still the most =
expensive footwear I have ever owned, limited edition skateboarding shoes w=
ith a colourful graffiti design, and blood.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The young woman who tended my wounds h=
as known me since I was proudly Rock Boy, and she was the girl who pulled o=
ut her hair in chunks to impress her friends. She applied antiseptic to my =
wound and laughed at my pain. Despite her old party trick, she has a full h=
ead of long silky hair. Despite my stupidity I did not get tetanus.</span><=
/p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Thanks to my injury we spent the rest =
of the night together. She said she had to look after me. I didn?t correct =
her.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She had gone into teaching which surpr=
ised me because of the terrible woman who?d overseen our first school toget=
her. When someone is so awful people only refer to them by their initials, =
they should fail the teacher exam. With her out there to balance the scales=
 I?m sure the children of Scotland stand a far better chance of a decent ed=
ucation.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She already knew about the piece of pa=
per which had predicted my death. She was at the party years before with th=
e girl who wanted to know about my shampoo but had to take her little siste=
r home after reminding everyone about my Rock Boy nickname, for which I?m s=
till grateful.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Our first date was going to see Green =

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I suppose fate works with what it gets=
 I?ve always had a bad memory. If I?d remembered the date, I was supposed =
to end up in a coma I would never have stood in the middle of the pavement =
asking to be hit by a car.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The poor old man roped in by fate to k=

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20

  <!--Full disclosure: Paul Jones Palin was no longer the voice of a genera=
tion. His death assumed to have happened on August 31, 2010, had people tal=
king all around the world because of its questionable nature. It wasn?t unt=
il September of 2017 that he was then declared dead in absentia. By that ti=
me everyone had not only stopped talking about P. J. Palin, they?d also pre=
tty much forgotten all about him. And so it goes, my children, and so it go=
es. That?s why it came as quite a surprise to most that after several undoc=
umented reported sightings of Mr. Palin it was confirmed that P. J. was sti=
ll very much alive. In fact, it was revealed that he was actually earning a=
 living as a doobie-smoking fisherman in the very town where he allegedly d=
ied: East Hampton, NY. What came as a bigger surprise to any who still reme=
mbered him was that this revelation occurred as a direct result of this rec=
ently resurrected ghost succumbing to an innocent craving for (are you read=
y for this?) ice cream. You may, or may not, remember the sensational headl=
ines and news coverage about his disappearance. Do you? Anyone? Somebody ou=
t there? Hands in the air, anybody? No? Well, that wouldn?t have been all t=
hat unusual considering how long ago it was and all that happened since. As=
 one adds up all the rumors surrounding the uncertainty of his demise you?d=
 probably conclude, as most people did, that his departure was just another=
 of the many unsolved mysteries of the universe. As Paul had often remarked=
 prior to his fishy passing, ?There are only three things I hold as being u=
nquestionably true. One, life is a mystery. Two, I am mystified. And three,=
 that reality is merely a collective hunch.? Yeah, he was that kind of guy,=
 I guess. It?s still kind of sketchy what Peege (a nickname his brother had=
 given him when they were both much younger) had been doing with himself fo=
r the past decade. As it turned out, he didn?t drown in the choppy waters o=
f the Atlantic Ocean nearly ten years ago when he took that fateful bike ri=
de on the Swedish Kronan bicycle (included as a complementary perk in the p=
rice of his rented room) at dawn from the Maidstone Hotel located at 207 Ma=
in Street in Long Island, NY. Instead, after apparently drifting atop the w=
aves for hours, his body had floated back to the same shoreline where Paul =
Jones Palin had earlier discarded the pajamas, he had worn on what he belie=
ved would?ve been his final day on Earth, on the then sun stained beach bef=
ore taking what he hoped would be a fatal swim into oblivion. It was said w=
hen he awoke, lying pajama-less, naked and cold on the wet sand at night wi=
th no idea of how he had gotten there, it was beneath a Lazarus moon. With =
only the moonlight shining through the darkness, Palin wandered along the b=
each in his birthday suit until finding an empty home that he broke into fo=
r clothes, food, and a place to sleep. For weeks, since it was now the begi=
nning of the off-season in The Hamptons, he hid out in the empty house, wit=
h its well-stocked food pantry and no other inhabitants. As he recovered fr=
om his attempt at suicide, and as he felt stronger, in the cover of nightti=
me darkness Peege would go out to explore the neighborhood. One night Paul =
happened upon an outdoor concert where a jam band named Phish was performin=
g and snuck into the show. After the last song, while the crew was loading =
up the equipment for the next stop on the long leg of the group?s tour, P. =
J. made his way to the stage and began lending a hand in the packing up pro=
cess. When all the equipment had been loaded up the road manager assigned e=
ach worker, including Peege, to various trucks, vans, and vehicles to be tr=
ansported to the next location. No one seemed to notice Palin?s presence, o=
r else they just may have assumed he was a member of the road crew, so he d=
ecided to go along for the ride. And like a band of gypsies, together on th=
e road, they traveled. Lots of miles, gigs, after-show parties, and years l=
ater after Peege decided to retire from life on the road he returned to Eas=
t Hampton where he reinvented himself as a doobie-smoking fisherman (sounds=
 like the name of a side project a Phish band member might have chosen). It=
 began as a part-time job that became a full-time occupation on a local cha=
rter fishing boat. As time passed, the aging Mr. Palin had saved enough mon=
ey to buy his own boat, which he chartered out for a hefty per diem fee to =
the town?s tourists. One night after getting wasted at his favorite tavern =
he stopped at The Candy Shoppe on #35 Newtown Lane for some ice cream to en=
joy on his way back home. It was almost ten years to the day since he?d ori=
ginally stopped there to buy a milkshake, which he would later use as his m=
agic milkshake laced with physician prescribed narcotics to be employed as =
the first step in his failed suicide attempt. The sense of d=E9j=E0 vu was =
as strong as a foul fart in a cramped elevator when Palin entered the store=
 The sensation quickly dispelled as he could literally feel the eyes of th=
e man who stood behind the counter studying him. ?I know you,? the now vagu=
ely familiar man began after eyeing him for several uncomfortable seconds, =
?I was working here the night you came in this store and left me the bigges=
t tip I?d ever been given because instead of putting that milkshake I made =
for you into one of my old boss?s paper takeout cups I poured it in that th=
ermos you had. My boss back then would?ve fired me if he found out. Not tha=
t it?d matter anymore?I own this place now. Man, after you disappeared the =
cops were here asking all kinds of questions about you. You became some kin=
d of Hamptons urban legend; did you know that??
P. J. froze for several moments as memories began floating up from beneath =
his murky subconscious to the surface of his conscious mind while he studie=
d the face of the man who had addressed him. It was the school kid working =
the counter back in 2010. The kid he had imagined was like the only son he =
had but never knew. Because his junkie ex-girlfriend, who after leaving Pal=
in, had given birth and never told her ex-boyfriend she was pregnant with t=
heir child. The child she had without a word to the father to let him know =
he had a son and was a father. The infant he only found out about after the=
 police contacted him to identify both bodies. The junkie ex-girlfriend who=
 had shot-up while nursing their son, only to overdose, nod out, die, then =
collapse upon and suffocate their tiny toddler. Panicking at the realizatio=
n his true identity had been discovered, in silence, Paul hurriedly bolted =
from the shop and returned home for a restless night of nightmares from the=
 past. After he left, The Candy Shoppe kid/man ended up calling an old frie=
nd who worked as a reporter for The East Hampton Star newspaper. By early t=
he next morning the reporter with a photographer, then the police, and next=
, a curious mob was at his door. The cat was out of the bag, and anew, P. J=
 Palin was officially a member of the living once again. Bombarded with qu=
estions, asked to clarify situations, issues, and dates, many of which he h=
ad neither answers nor solutions or recollections of, he was thrust unwilli=
ngly into the glare of a 24-7-365 nonstop news cycle spotlight. It was duri=
ng the first and only on-air interview that Paul Jones Palin uttered eleven=
 words which made him a social media celebrity and icon, ?No comment, I am =
no longer the voice of any generation.? And that, my friends, was his final=
 word on the subject. For many this was the end of the story. But for P. J.=
 Palin, an unsought new chapter had just been written?.-->
