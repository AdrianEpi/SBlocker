  <!--"It's cold tonight," Croix says into the comfortable silence of the W=
A.L.T.E.R library after dark. He often came here to read or study up on th=
e many worlds that joined together through W.A.L.T.E.R. Croix spent much of=
 his time alone. He learned a long time ago it was safer that way. As a Ull=
adyrean, Croix hails from an inhospitable world, and though he's no longer =
there, old habits die hard. Adalind adjusted her scarf as she read the book=
 laid out on the desk in front of her. "What?" She looks over to Croix. The=
y had been assigned the night shift to keep on an eye on the library. When =
she was first recruited, she didn't believe in other worlds, let alone a li=
brary that was at the center of them all. "I was attempting small talk," Cr=
oix explains. He makes a gesture at his throat, indicating her scarf. "It's=
 cold, isn't it?"
Adalind laughs softly. "Yeah, it's a little chilly in here. I can check to =
see if the heat's on? I don't know if they turned it off when they locked u=
p. Sometimes they do."
"I'm all right," Croix says. He places a fingertip beneath one eye, pointin=
g out the tell-tale reptilian slit. "I'm good with a lot."
"Right, cold, not a problem." Adalind laughs again. A gentle and soft sound=
 "I'll go check anyway. Want anything while I'm up there?" The W.A.L.T.E.R=
 library had two floors of books and then a top floor used for book reading=
s. "A bottled water, if there's any left?" Croix asks hopefully. "On it," A=
dalind calls. She makes her way to find the ac and turns it so it wouldn't =
be so cool. She rubs at her arms and is on her way to get two bottled water=
s when she spots a staff on the floor. The staff was near the Erealle aisle=
 "What's this about?" She makes her way to it and picks it up carefully. E=
very good librarian knows to be extra careful with the objects and the book=
s. "Croix! Can you come up here a minute?"
Croix was on his feet and running for the stairs in an instant. "What is it=
?" He asks, head swiveling like a dog on the hunt as he searches for someth=
ing to fight. "There was a staff on the floor..." Adalind look around the a=
isle. "Do you see anything off?"
Croix strides alongside the stacks. "Nothing else is amiss," he says, retur=
ning to her. She places the staff back on its shelf. "You don't think... Ma=
ybe it wasn't put back all the way after the Agents made it back?"
"Doubtful," Croix says with reluctance. "Inappropriate handling of artifact=
s is a demoting offense."
Adalind had a strange feeling nagging at her. "I don't know... Something ju=
st doesn't feel right."
"I feel prickly," Croix says, staring at the staff. It was a feeling akin t=
o the hair standing up on the back of his neck, only it was all over. A sud=
den brush of wind goes past her calves. She falls forward and is thankfully=
 caught by Croix. "... I have a bad feeling something got out."
The lights directly above them explode. "I'd say you're right," Croix says,=
 hastily righting them after the dive out of the way. "Great." She sighs. "=
You get the gun, I'll get the net." She pats his chest before stepping arou=
nd him to find where they last put the net. It always seemed to be in a dif=
ferent place after creatures got loose. Croix wordlessly makes for the smal=
l hall leading to this floor's staff room. His chest feels strangely warm a=
s he opens the vault and retrieves the gun and ammo. He returns to Adalind'=
s side as the lights come back on. "It appears we're being toyed with."
"Must be a trickster... I'll get the Erealle world book," she says. After s=
he gets the net. Adalind has to get on a stool to get the net from the top =
shelf in the Uryall aisle. "Oh no..." The stool she stands on falls out fro=
m under her, and she screams as she goes falling. As Croix runs to catch he=
r, his feet are knocked out from under him. He falls flat on his stomach, a=
nd an instant later, Adalind falls on him. "This trickster has it out for y=
ou," he wheezes. "It would appear so..." Adalind rolls off his back. "Are y=
ou okay??" She puts a hand to his back. "I lost the gun," Croix says, sitti=
ng up with Adalind's help. "I'll be all right," he adds, noting the look on=
 her face. He offers her his arm. "Tough skin."
She takes his arm. "Still..." Adalind picks up the net. "I'll get the book.=
" she watches him go and sets off down the aisle, net raised high, in searc=
h of the world book. The gun should have been nearby, but it was in none of=
 the obvious places. Croix considers the dangers this might pose. Only W.A.=
L.T.E.R agents or librarians should be able to handle the weaponry. That wa=
s the general rule, but Croix wouldn't be surprised if this trickster found=
 a way around that, though. Adalind hears snickering echoing around her. "W=
hatever you are, you have come to the wrong place!" she calls. "No," a dise=
mbodied voice says. "I'm right where I want to be!"
"Oh great," Croix says sarcastically. "It talks."
"Just what we need," Adalind grumbles. She keeps on alert as she steps thro=
ugh the aisle. "You won't be able to leave the building, you know? It's war=
ded."
"Why would I want to leave?" the voice asks. "Why did you come here in the =
first place?" Croix asks, joining Adalind. "It does seem to be rather fooli=
sh on your part," Adalind says. She nods for Croix to head toward the right=
 while she went toward the left. "Have you ever been trapped?" The voice as=
ks, a few inches lower than a moment before. Croix soundlessly circles to t=
he right. As he gets into position, he spots the gun beneath a study desk a=
t the end of the aisle. "Actually, yes," Adalind says. She gestures for him=
 to wait on her signal. She could feel a tingling in her temples that told =
her it was closer than she'd like. If she was a trickster, there's only one=
 place she would be. Closing her eyes, she eases her breathe and waits. The=
 second she feels the rush of air at her skin, she strikes out with the net=
 Croix takes the opportunity to dive for the gun. He sets it to sleep and =
fires it into the thrashing net. The trickster screams, outraged, then fall=
s silent. "I didn't kill it," Croix says into the silence. He stands and se=
ts the gun's safety back on. "Tricksters are hard to kill." Adalind sighs. =
"And to catch. Even with sensing." She removes her scarf and drops it onto =
the floor before the little demon had any ideas about choking her with it. =
"Let's stuff it in the vault and leave it for the morning shift," Croix sug=
gests. Adalind eyes the net. "Good idea. They can deal with it." She leads =
the march to the vault. He opens the door, and she tosses the trickster int=
o the warded room. She yanks the net back in time for Croix's to close the =
door. "Just another night at the library."
Croix glances at the wall clock. "And there are hours left yet till morning=

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read was preparing to pull the shut=
ters of&nbsp;<em>Books on Wheels</em>&nbsp;and was looking forward to a qui=
et evening with a drop of brandy.<em>&nbsp;</em>Moving stiffly and avoiding=
 any twists, he managed to pull down the side door of the van, locking away=
 its contents.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;"><em>Books on Wheels</em>&nbsp;used to =
be an ordinary white Ford Transit. One day it fell into the capable hands o=
f an inspired senior and its fate shifted.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">When Dave was 9 he landed his first an=
d best job - delivering newspapers. He often pondered on these memories as =
the days that shaped his life. He loved the feeling of the paper, fresh out=
 of the press, folded nicely and ready to be creased by someone's strong gr=
ip and later thorn to pieces by a toddler or chewed by a puppy. The best pa=
rt was that he could do it while riding his brand new bike. His father only=
 agreed to get it for him if he would take on the job. He remembered the ha=
ppiness that filled his chest as he was blasting through the early morning =
freshness. Dave wasn't much interested in school but he loved reading. He m=
anaged to graduate but only just and never continued his education. Then, u=
sing his gift for stubbornness, he got a job at a small library and stayed =
there for 48 years. His only children and lovers were his books. People kne=
w him as the one always carrying an open book in front of his eyes and repe=
atedly stumbling due to incapability to put it down. Naturally, people star=
ted calling him Mr Read and the name stuck to him like a melted chewing gum=
&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Everything went out of hand when he re=
tired and found himself with too many bills and not enough life worth livin=
g. He kept on thinking about his childhood bike and the freedom it gave him=
 This is how, just after his 70th birthday, Mr Read took the impulsive dec=
ision to sell his parents' home, where he had lived all his life. He only k=
ept his books. Then he bought his new destiny in the form of a Ford Transit=
&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read was a bookworm but he was also=
 a very capable handyman. He didn't believe in paying people to do what he =
could do and thus, slowly, despite his bent back and shaky hands, changed t=
he side door of the van. He imagined how it would open right up and would d=
isplay all its treasures to the public, while at the same time providing a =
cozy shade for all. The inside of the van was transformed into bookshelves =
and Mr Read made sure he had something for even the most capricious of tast=
es.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He removed the useless passenger seat =
and opened a passageway between the front and the back of the van. There, o=
n the floor, among all his favorite paper friends, he would lay out his sle=
eping bag and would have the best dreams of his life. His small amount of p=
ossessions were all neatly stored in boxes above the bookshelves. Under his=
 driver's seat he had a couple of mugs, some cutlery and a tiny travelers' =
gas stove.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read found himself thinking about p=
eople and their houses full of possessions and wondered why they needed the=
m. They probably thought of him as a hobo. But no, he was no hobo. He had h=
is home right here.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The white Ford Transit metamorphosed i=
nto<em>&nbsp;Books on Wheels</em>. Mr Read was proud to own the smallest pu=
blic library in the region. He wished to think that it was the smallest one=
 in the country, but he had heard of a boy who turned a phone box into a li=
brary. He had to admit that it is probably smaller than&nbsp;<em>Books on W=
heels</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read had a strict schedule that he =
followed each week. Every day he would spend at a different location so tha=
t the whole town had a chance to borrow a book. He had a small box for dona=
tions but he didn't really rely on them for much. He still had quite a sum =
left from the house and he didn't plan to ever use it up completely. In the=
 evenings he would take out his thick diary and write a few sentences of ho=
w the day went. He would put down all the borrowed books and all the return=
ed ones. Mr Read didn't approve of using pens, because he disliked that ink=
 couldn't be erased. A pencil and a rubber was a lot more sensible, Mr Read=
 believed.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Tonight was Friday and right on schedu=
le,&nbsp;<em>Books on Wheels</em>&nbsp;was resting in the car park of the b=
ig ASDA supermarket just outside the city center. All knew who Mr Read was =
and no one minded him staying there.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He had just climbed into the van when =
he saw Big Tim approaching the van. With his broad shoulders and impressive=
 height, Big Tim used to be a promising rugby player back in the day. After=
 suffering numerous head injuries, however, he decided to invest in a teach=
ing degree and became a PE teacher. When that part of his life was over, he=
 had to retire. He never got used to the quiet life afterwards and so nowad=
ays he found his contentment by being the local supermarket security, and o=
ften after his shift has ended - Mr Read's brandy companion.&nbsp;</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Tonight, however, Big Tim had a dark l=
ook to his stride, his shoulders were slacking and the lines on his face lo=
oked like deep cracks in dry soil. He walked to the side of the van and ope=
ned the passenger door, without saying a word.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?A glass??, Mr Read offered.</span></p=
>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Please,? Big Tim croaked and climbed =
inside.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?You seem a bit off, tonight?</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Aren't you? I am devastated. What wou=
ld her kids do now? Who would take care of them? Will they go to their gran=
dparents or what? They can't stay with that moron.? Big Tim was rushing wit=
h words while opening up a small foldable chair.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Who are you talking about, Tim? I am =
tired and you are making no sense.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Have you completely lost your marbles=
? Beth, I am talking about! Beth!? Big Tim sank down onto the chair. ?Dead =
Beth. It was all over the news.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read felt the ground pulling him, f=
elt he was falling even though he was sitting. He accidentally spilled his =
drink and started shaking all over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;Beth was a persistently tipsy mi=
ddle-aged housewife on the constant verge of a midlife crisis. Having four =
kids by the age of 35 and no work experience, she was now in the vicious ci=
rcle of always relying on state benefits and never having enough to invest =
in higher education. She liked a drink, that much was true, but she loved a=
 good read as well. She was one of the regulars at&nbsp;<em>Books on Wheels=
</em>&nbsp;and Mr Read had unintentionally started thinking of her as his n=
ot so fortunate but very fragile daughter. He always looked forward to Satu=
rdays, when he would park&nbsp;<em>Books on Wheels</em>&nbsp;by the gardens=
 and would spend all day with her and her children. The youngest ones made =
him smile with their silly ways.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Big Tim was holding him now by the sho=
ulders.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Dave, Dave?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read didn't have many friends even =
though everyone knew him. At the age of 79 his friends and lovers were stil=
l his books. Except for Big Tim. Except for Beth. Dead Beth.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Dave, don't die on me, old boy!?</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He was now shaking him.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?What do you mean Beth...?</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read was looking forward to tomorro=
w. It would have been Saturday and Beth had promised him to return some rea=
lly overdue children's' books. He would then surprise her youngest kid with=
 a brand new The Gruffalo's Child hardback. Then they would drink tea while=
 the kids played around them.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?This morning, Dave, don't tell me you=
 didn't hear?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?All day I was here, it was quiet...? =
Mr Read had indeed spent the whole day at the car park with only a couple o=
f short walks to the nearby portable loo.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Dave, Dave?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?For fuck's sake, stop shaking me, Tim=
!?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Big Tim pulled back</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?I thought you knew.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Then Big Tim told him all. Beth had a =
few drinks last night and just like always, she had a loud argument with he=
r man. A useless waste of space, not a man, if you asked Mr Read. A poison,=
 not a father, if you asked Mr Read.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Big Tim told him how she was still a b=
it tipsy in the morning when she went to the nearby bakery to get something=
 for the kids. The police had concluded that she never saw the big Mercedes=
 that went through her. She died before she knew anything happened. She had=
 hit her head on a pavement edge, and it had resulted in an instant death. =
Her blue scarf soaked in bright blood. The Mercedes driver was a young woma=
n, gone hysterical. She had repeated over and over that the woman came out =
of nowhere. And Mr Read knew that she probably did. She was tipsy and carel=
ess, angry at her moron of a man, worried about money and god knows what el=
se.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read's lips were trembling now, his=
 vision blurred by tears not quite falling yet. He swallowed painfully and =
tried to down the immense pain in his chest, the stinging salty drops, the =
impossible sense of end.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?When's the funeral?? he couldn't thin=
k of anything else to ask.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?Don't know, these things take time. S=
uch a loss. She was alright.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">More than&nbsp;<em>alright</em>, Mr Re=
ad thought. She was capable of making him feel like a father and a grandfat=
her without being either of these things.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">There was not much to talk about after=
wards. They sat and stared through the windscreen, taking slow sips of bran=
dy and not once saying&nbsp;<em>Cheers</em>. There was nothing to be cheerf=
ul for when a young person has found a premature end.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Some time later Big Tim left. Mr Read =
continued to stare through the window, incapable of comprehending anything =
that happened tonight. Life seemed so peaceful recently and he guessed that=
 was a sign that something would go down abruptly.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read took out his diary and stared =
at today's entry. Not a single book borrowed or returned. A day wasted. He =
took out a rubber from his front shirt pocket and erased today's date. He w=
anted to erase the whole day. He closed the diary and continued sipping his=
 brandy.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read had lived a calm life and it w=
as a happy life. Mr Read wanted the same for Beth. Or at least to get the c=
hance of having one.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">---</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read woke up early on the driver's =
seat. He must have fallen asleep here. His phone told him it was Friday aga=
in today. This was a curious thing that has never happened before.</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read had a little idea. He went ove=
r to the supermarket. It was the only 24 hour shop in town and he thought i=
t was just so handy right now. He bought a few doughnuts and croissants and=
 returned to the van.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read started the engine and went st=
raight to Beth.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She opened the door, while wrapping a =
blue scarf around her and getting ready to go out. When she saw him her smi=
le was bright even though her eyes told a drunken story of arguments and te=
ars.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read passed her the breakfast, toge=
ther with The Gruffalo's Child.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?No need to go to the bakery, now?, he=
 told her and returned to the van.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She asked him to come in for a cup of =
coffee.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read waved at her with polite refus=
al. He felt content.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Mr Read knew there was a Mercedes some=
where waiting for him and he didn't have much time left to find it.</span><=
/p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Clouds were starting to roll in, I gla=
nced quickly at the sky to see how much time I had before it rained. I ran =
faster when the first few drops started to wet the sidewalk. I weaved throu=
gh busy people heading to work, nearly pushing people over. I clutched the =
book tightly to my chest. I had the bus stop in my sights. I looked down at=
 my new watch. I had a minute and thirty seconds before the bus would be he=
re and I was too far away. I had to run faster, this was the last day to re=
turn my book before I was charged and I needed every penny I could muster i=
n order to live, living wasn't cheap.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Oi! Slow down, this isn't a 5k&q=
uot; Someone shouted as I ran past. I waved them off and continued to run. =
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a green city bus round the corner.&nbsp;=
<em>No, I'm almost there.. If I could just get there....</em></span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The bus stopped at the stop and opened=
 its folding doors, letting the line of people through.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Hold up, I'm almost there!&quot;=
 I shouted. The people in the line gave me a few stares, but no one said an=
ything as the last person filed on. The bust closed its doors and started b=
ack up.&nbsp;<em>Dang it.&nbsp;</em>I looked back at my watch. Great. I had=
 two hours to figure out a way to get to the library.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">In all honesty, I should have made an =
effort to return this book days ago, but it was the best book I had ever re=
ad and I had trouble letting it go. It helped me find a way to escape as I =
dealt with the most stressful time of my life. College entry exams could de=
termine the rest of my life, and I couldn't fail, otherwise I would have no=
thing.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The book grew heavy in my arms. I trie=
d my best to shield it from the heavy downpour covering the city, there was=
 nothing worse than returning a book almost late, nonetheless damaged, they=
 would have my head if it was damaged.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Need a ride?&quot; A man in a fu=
ll leather biking suit rolled up to the sidewalk. I considered his offer, a=
nd graciously sat on the back behind him. Everything I'd ever heard of stra=
nger danger flooded my head as I fastened on the helmet he handed me and th=
e thought did occur to me that he might take me to an alley and murder me o=
r something.. But I had no choice. I was willing to risk death for this boo=
k.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The man floored the gas pedal and we s=
ped through the city, rain plastering my hair to my head and stinging my fa=
ce.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Where to?!&quot; He said. The ra=
in drowned out my voice significantly, so I had to yell over that and the s=
ound of the motor bike.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;The library on tenth avenue, ple=
ase&quot;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He nodded and made a left turn, the bi=
ke went so low to the ground on the turn I thought we were done for.</span>=
</p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Relief flooded my system as we sped th=
rough the streets, approaching the library. I could see the domed spires th=
rough the skyscrapers and sat back, enjoying the ride.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He dropped me off on the sidewalk outs=
ide the library, and just as I was getting ready to open the door, I was kn=
ocked to the ground by something larger than me. I struggled underneath it,=
 clutching my book in a death grip. I felt a clawed hand run its fingernail=
s down my arm, and curl around the book.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;No! Anything but the book&quot; =
I yelled. &quot;Here, take my wallet if you must, just don't take that!&quo=
t;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I heard a rough growl as the book was =
wrenched violently from my fingers. Whatever it was was off in the next sec=
ond, running down the sidewalk. I took a deep breath to prepare myself for =
more running and I took off after it.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">There was no option for me to fall beh=
ind. Ahead of me, there was a cloaked figure going at full speed through th=
e crowds. I followed, keeping my eyes on it as it took side streets and eve=
n went through a busy intersection at one point.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Why would you need to steal a fa=
ntasy book?&quot; I yelled at its back. It turned its head briefly and set =
its unnaturally yellow eyes on me. They seemed to pierce my soul, set in th=
e shadows of the hood, the eyes were the only thing I could see of its face=
</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">We continued to run through crowds, al=
most knocking down the owner of a hotdog stand.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I was getting closer, catching up. The=
 thing started to slow, looking back and forth rapidly, like it felt stuck.=
 We were in an alley off to the side of thirteenth avenue.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Looks like you're stuck.&quot; I=
 said. &quot;If you'll kindly return what's mi--&quot;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The being suddenly leapt up impossibly=
 high, landing on an awning above my heat. Leathery black wings erupted fro=
m its back as it flew to the rooftop. Then it occurred to me. The yellow ey=
es, the leathery wings, this was like a creature from my book. A gargoyle. =
I'm not sure how it was possible, but the proof of its existence was right =
in front of me.. or should I say above me..</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;"><em>How the heck was I supposed to get=
 up there.</em></span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Thoughts ran through my head and I not=
iced the building next to me had its doors open, a doorman welcoming people=
 through. I approached the door and stood close enough to a couple going in=
 that it looked like I could be with them. They approached the front of the=
 line and went in. I was about to follow when the doorman held up a gloved =
hand in my face.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Who are you? you don't live here=
&quot; He said.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I bit my lip with anxiety and thought =
through my options. I couldn't come up with a convincing enough lie so, I j=
ust pointed into the distance, down the street. &quot;What's that?!&quot; I=
 said.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He looked in the direction I was point=
ing, and I dashed inside, pushing him over in the process.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I ran past him into the lobby of the a=
partment complex and found the door to the stairway. I yanked open the door=
 and started on the first step.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Stop that girl!&quot; The voice =
of the doorman echoed through the lobby and I saw several faces look at me =
before the stairwell door closed loudly. I frantically ran up the stairs, h=
oping to reach the third floor before they started following me, but to my =
dismay, the door opened, and security officers were hot on my heals. I was =
nearly to the second floor when an officer grabbed me by the hair and tried=
 to yank me down. I kicked him in the shins and started taking the stairs t=
wo at a time.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I heard the officers getting farther a=
way, so I sped up. I slowed as I saw a door in front of me. Finally, I'd re=
ached the eighth floor, the top of the building. I wrenched the door open a=
nd saw the creature perched on the ledge of the building hunched over my bo=
ok. It was poised as if it was about to start ripping out pages. I slipped =
on the rain puddles and hurried over to it.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot; I yelled =
as it set its creepy eyes upon me.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I barreled towards it at full speed. I=
t spread its wings as it was ready to take off again, and I would never see=
 that book again. I ran forward and tackled it off the side of the building=
 Wind rushed through my hair as we fell, freefalling off the tallest heigh=
t I had ever been. My scream was drowned out by the wind as I grappled for =
the book. The creature flapped its wings and we flew over the tops of the b=
uildings.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;You will take me back to the lib=
rary, and you will give that back to me.&quot; I commanded. The gargoyle hi=
ssed and, to my surprise, swooped towards tenth avenue.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">We flew toward the ground at top speed=
, I closed my eyes as we got closer to the ground, it looked like he wasn't=
 going to stop.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I looked at my watch quickly, I had tw=
o minutes.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Please don't crash.&quot; I said=
</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The gargoyle landed gracefully on the =
sidewalk, attracting stares from the people passing by.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I yanked the book from its claws, near=
ly ripping it, and ran towards the doors, hoping to make it in time.</span>=
</p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;You were a worthy opponent this =
time, don't expect me to be easy to beat next time.&quot; A voice pushed it=
s way into my thoughts. I looked back to see the gargoyle's stare one last =
time and then it was gone, up into the inky black night sky.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Someone was putting up a &quot;Closed&=
quot; sign when I got to the door.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Please let me in&quot; I pleaded=
</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">As if out of pity, the man sighed, and=
 unlocked the door for me.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Thanks!&quot; I said and approac=
hed the counter. Rain drops fell off my coat and my brown hair was in disar=
ray, like a bird's nest on my head. I slammed the book down on the counter,=
 trying to catch my breath and looked into the eyes of the frightened libra=
rian.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;I'm here! It isn't late.&quot; I=
 said. She took the soggy book from the counter and stared at me in disbeli=
ef.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Was that you outside?&quot; She =
asked?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I nodded and she scanned the book back=
 into the system.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She sighed. &quot;While the book isn't=
 late, it is damaged.&quot; She said.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Please don't charge me. I'll do =
better next time.&quot;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She considered me for a second before =
saying, &quot;I won't charge you, but you need to come in for the next two =
weeks and do community service&quot; She said.</span></p>=20
