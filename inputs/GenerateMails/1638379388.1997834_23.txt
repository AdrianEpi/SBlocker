1944, the field is ploughed and ready for planting.&nbsp;Jack imagines he i=

is so filled with joy that she feels that she will burst into crystal confe=

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was a fishing village as far back a=
s she could remember. With waves crashing against the grey of the shore, th=
eir foam soaking people through. And little by little, every time the foam =
landed on them, they got a little of the Sea; until they became one, their =
minds liquid as Hers, an array of emotions only She could ever fathom.</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">And oh, how they adored Her.</span></p=
>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She was the Mother that birthed them a=
ll, the divine blue of their quiet lives.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was a quiet village indeed, and as =
the grey and blue washed over them, nobody took more than they needed, givi=
ng thanks to Her for their food.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">When the light couldn?t reach them, Sh=
e delivered.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">And in the middle of the summer, when =
the sun reached its highest point, they offered thanks to Mother for having=
 survived another year, for seeing another solstice.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">They feared Her as much as they adored=
 Her; Her rage was dangerous, but it was the only home they ever knew.</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was a rough life, and they all knew=
 it, but at the same time she couldn?t think of anyone that left. People st=
ayed and the village grew with them, community gardens to the south, wheat =
fields to the east.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was beautiful.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">And year after year they prayed to the=
 Sea, gave offerings of honey and salt, Listened to Her wishes. And year af=
ter year She delivered.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Until She didn?t.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The fish grew scarce for the first tim=
e in four lifetimes, the hungry mouths growing one by one. And people came =
to her to give them her blessings, prayers over the boats that left to the =
Sea, crying children that had never been hungry in their lives.</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She called for a village meeting, goin=
g door to door, and people trembled, listened, for she was the Vatar, Maste=
r of the Tides, head of the Council of the Tides. They had been blessed by =
the Mother Herself to control Her waters, the push and pull of Her heartbea=
t, and she was the strongest of them all.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was a quiet village, so when she ca=
lled of someone angering Mother, she was met with shaking disbelief; things=
 like that didn?t happen, had never happened; not in her time, nor in the t=
ime of her mother before her.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">?One of you offended Her,? she insiste=
d,? and I want the rest of you to keep your eyes open.?</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She could feel Her rage in the white t=
hat hit the shore, in the fishing boats filled with water, in the violent s=
hifts of Her currents. Never before had Her waters held anything but life i=
n them.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was when the body of a boy washed a=
shore that she knew. Somebody had killed him; a blood offering to the Sea, =
against their solemn oaths. It was blasphemy.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She had her suspicions, of course she =
did. They were talks of zealots trying to harness Her power through blood, =
in defiance to the Council and its laws. But she and the Council went door =
to door nonetheless, Feeling, Listening for the offender.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He was a boy of sixteen, blind with th=
e yearning of power; he?d slain his twin for it.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">This had never happened before, nothin=
g like that ever had. The Council met for three days and two nights, mediat=
ing on the wishes of the Sea, trying to piece together Her rage piece by pi=
ece.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She had been tarnished, and She wanted=
 the boy to pay.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She had been the Vatar for nearly four=
 decades, yet the humanity of Her still terrified her. She was in mourning,=
 an angry force ready to destroy with the pushes and pulls of Her temper.</=
span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">When she visited the boy, he cried, be=
gged for her pardon as the Vatar, swore that power blinded him, didn?t let =
him understand what he did.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She listened, and consoled, for she kn=
ew very well the demands of power -she was the Vatar after all, the human v=
essel of the Sea- and not few times in her youth had she yearned for more.<=
/span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Yet, she met him as an equal. Spoke to=
 him of the Commands of the Mother, finite in their regard. They boy listen=
ed and wept; but understood. There was red on his hands, and it was the onl=
y way She could be pleased, the only way justice could be restored.</span><=
/p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">That night she prayed to the Sea, her =
words careful, a child to a hurt parent, soothing as the honey rolling off =
her hands. She asked of Her to cleanse his soul, to choose forgiveness over=
 revenge. She spoke to Her the way she saw Her on warm summer afternoons, t=
he light dancing on Her, shrinking Her down to human measurements.</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She was met with silence.</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">They put him in the boat in the mornin=
g. The shore was empty but for her and the Council, not even the boy?s pare=
nts had the heart to face him after what he?d done.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It was a peaceful sunrise, one of the =
most beautiful the little fishing village had ever seen, the blue of the sk=
y speaking of new. The Sea was calm, the sun glimmering on the tiniest ripp=
les that broke Her surface.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The boy understood, watching stoically=
 for the most part, his hands dripping in honey.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">A handful of salt tossed into the Sea,=
 prayers spoken over honey, hands intertwined together. The Council formed =
the ceremonial circle, reaching out to her. She joined hands with the Elder=
s and let the power of the Sea wash over them. It was a dark, pulsing grey,=
 Her pain, Her disgust of being tarnished for power, Her hatred beating ste=
adily as a heartbeat.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The Council took it all in. They chant=
ed, raising the currents that would take him away from the shore, the pushe=
s and pulls of Her heartbeat. H<a style=3D"color: #ffffff;" href=3D"=

  <!--Divine Bloodline
?How can you tell the Tree is a girl, Gran?? The shea butter applied to my =
scalp in neat little rows slid onto my forehead and mixed with beads of swe=
at as I sat on the front porch between my grandmother?s knees.  Every Sunda=
y, we took my braids down and washed my hair. Then Gran braided it right ba=
ck up again, greasing my scalp as she went. I can?t imagine a Sunday that w=
e didn?t spend together, managing the mane that fell past my waist. It took=
 all day, but the best part was sittin? on that porch, listening to her tel=
l stories about our family and the land that provided for us over a hundred=
 years. The oldest member of our family is The Tree, who we simply referred=
 to as She or Her. It?s fitting because She isn?t limited to being called o=
ne thing, She is everything. Her roots reached up from the ground and loope=
d back beneath the soil at odd angles that tripped you up if you tried to e=
scape ? even from over thirty feet away. If you didn?t know her and dared t=
o venture towards her massive trunk you might not make it out alive. Gran t=
old me She?s been here since the beginning of time, always adding a new fac=
t that she deemed age appropriate for me to obsess over for weeks until I a=
ppeared ready for a new story. ?Simple, baby girl,? she replied as she slid=
 a rattail comb across my scalp. I closed my eyes and relished the minty ti=
ngle that the occasional wind brought to us while she told me, again, about=
 the family history Mama should be telling me had she not ran away. I wasn?=
t old enough for that story yet, but that never stopped me from asking on M=
other?s Day or my birthday. Or any day. ?You can tell she is a WOMAN becaus=
e she?s lived longer than anything and anyone who?s stepped foot near her. =
This tree been watching us our whole family?s lifetime- over our great-grea=
t-great grandmothers when they were your age and getting strong enough to h=
elp when needed. She?s seen a lotta life, and even more death. She comforts=
 the heavy hearts and bears the weight of our sins; sins no man can handle =
on his own.? She snorted to herself and for the first time I became aware t=
hat I didn?t know any living male relatives. She pauses to take a sip from =
her iced tea and a drag from a cigarette she rolled herself. ?There will ne=
ver be a time anything of male blood could bear the weight of a woman, whic=
h is why they seek to destroy. You see She wears chips from man?s axe, but =
she still stands. Fire couldn?t bring her to her knees. One, one hundred pl=
us men have hung from her branches and none have yet to string her or any w=
oman living among her roots.?
Sometimes I think she can read my mind. Gran, not the She. But She probably=
 can too. ?And that?s why we never have to leave, because she provides as f=
ar she can reach.? I recited this with Gran after the end of each tree stor=
y. I left home for school and the occasional outing, but that was about it.=
 I didn?t make many friends because the town knew about our strange female =
coven and most kept their distance. Everything else I gleaned from the worl=
d came from the screen of my iPhone gifted to me for my birthday.  =20
Our home was its own bustling community where people came to us and everyth=
ing we could ever want was, just like Gran said, the Tree provides as far a=
s she could reach. Deliveries were left at the gate separating our Paradise=
 from the rest of the peasants around us. Living on land that shared its ev=
er-changing mysteries never made me long for the world outside until now. I=
 rode horses and took care of farm animals all day, we lived on land owned =
by our ancestors, it?s a rare miracle that despite the Oklahoma Land Run an=
d Trail of Tears, our family managed to defend our Tree and everything arou=
nd her. Weeks after my thirteenth birthday while watching makeup tutorials =
I felt an unfamiliar feeling that I?d been preparing for since I turned ele=
ven. I rushed to the bathroom and nearly screamed when I saw what I?d hoped=
 for- my first period. I?m officially a woman. I called to Gran with the go=
od news, and she nodded solemnly. I saw on tiktok that people had period pa=
rties and assumed she needed time to plan so I went back to my cat eye vide=
os, hoping she chose Black Forest, the canned cherries made more sense than=
 a boring red velvet. ?Come on, girl, we goin' on a walk.? Gran opened my b=
edroom door and motioned for me to get up. Her light grey dress grazed the =
floor and her waist-length braids swung behind her, making her appear more =
Celestial than usual. I jumped up and joined her, leaving my phone behind. =
She didn?t have to tell me where we were going; She?d been calling all morn=
ing. I caught up to Gran and she handed me a bag of candles. I guess the ca=
ke was already there, but I also worried that she might not know about how =
they celebrate the beginning of becoming a woman in this century. I don?t t=
hink people her age even gets periods anymore. ?Don?t worry ?bout what I do=
 and don?t get.? She pushed me forward and I tripped over a root that I?d n=
ever noticed before. Gran giggled to herself and took a drag from her cigar=
ette. The walk took nearly ten minutes to reach Her, but the land spread ar=
ound her almost like a red carpet; allowing a view that felt and looked mor=
e beautiful as you inched closer.  Warm wind lifted the hair on my arms and=
 thin silvery clouds parted to brandish a full, pink moon. ?Strawberry Moon=
,? Gran?s eyes twinkled as she lifted the sleeve to her dress, revealing a =
large tattoo on her arm that looked almost identical to the moon in the sky=
 Got this when I was 37.  It means something different for me every year. =
It felt like seeing her for the first time. A tattoo sleeve from the top of=
 her shoulder to her wrist boasted that I?d failed to notice in my fourteen=
 years of life. Was my Grandmother, with her dreadlocked hair and tattoos e=
xciting before she became a grandmother? I couldn?t imagine her existing be=
fore me. When we finally approached the base of Her massive trunk Gran lit =
a bundle of sage while I placed the candles around a small space facing the=
 moon- it would have taken hundreds to completely circle Her and the thirte=
en candles to signify my age made Her look enormous but still somehow, incr=
edibly feminine. The glow almost seemed to dress Her in shadows that would =
have scared me had I not become a woman today; it excited me. =20
We sat beneath Her outstretched branches and the moonlight played a soundle=
ss rhythm that danced with the nighttime sounds. The creek full of fish tha=
t I jumped into fearlessly all summer long rushed in the distance, the leav=
es rippled like tiny flags in different octaves and the animals sang in tun=
e. At that moment I realized that whatever I felt coursing through my veins=
 skipped a generation. If Mama held an ounce of what I felt from this divin=
e bloodline we inherited, she never would have left us.--->
