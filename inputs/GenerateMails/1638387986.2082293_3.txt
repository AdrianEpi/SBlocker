    <!--Neri hugs her cloak tighter to her. "That woman is deranged. I don'=
t care if she is a queen. She's deranged." She huffs. "Making us stomp all =
the way out in the Wyldwood just for... some cherry berry tart thing." Ther=
e was a time when Neri's life was incredibly normal. She would have even ca=
lled it boring. Then she inherited a manor from a relative she never knew e=
xisted and discovered that distant cousins from the 1920s were alive and we=
ll. Not only were they living, but they were the queen and her brother over=
 the Court of Madness.       "Oh, I thought you meant for trapping me here,=
" Iki says, stuffing her hands in her pockets. It's been about a week now, =
but Iki still can't quite believe it. "It is odd that we have to go."
      "That too. But I thought that went without saying." Neri looks around=
 at the trees. "Are they moving? Because I swear, that's the tree that trie=
d to hit me earlier."
      Iki pauses mid-step. "I think it is..." she picks her way to the near=
est tree and checks the moss at its roots. "Yep," she sighs. "We're going i=
n circles."
      Neri huffs. "I knew it. I knew that tree looked the same. And did you=
 notice that as soon as we stepped into the woods, the trees suddenly looke=
d normal? This is the land of the fae, all the weird everything, yet it loo=
ks like we're at home in the woods. I'm going to go with this being some el=
aborate trick on us." Neri glances at her friend. "I bet there aren't even =
berries out here."
      "Maybe we should be looking for baked tarts," Iki agrees. She reaches=
 for Neri, and they loop arms.       "You think she put baked tarts out her=
e for us to find?" Neri thought finding out she still had cousins would be =
a good thing. And it was, at first, when she found out about the manor and =
Iki met her new boyfriend, Pascal. But then Neri's deranged cousin decided =
that Iki should stay in the fae court, and she still wouldn't budge on the =
subject. "With Alyvia... I really don't know."
      "I wouldn't be surprised, honestly, but I actually thought maybe ther=
e are tart growing bushes here. Madness and all..."
      "... That is a very disturbing but ... easily true thought." Neri kic=
ks at a bush. "Not that one." She kicks another one and receives a yelp in =
return. She and Iki jolt backward. "That one talked."
      "You made it yelp!" Iki cries, clinging to Neri. "I didn't know bushe=
s yelp!"
      "Maybe something is in the bush... Maybe we disturbed a home?" Neri c=
arefully steps forward and gets sprayed with water. At least she hoped it w=
as water. She sees a red-capped head bolt away. Laughter left in its wake. =
"Still in the Court."
      "We're on a mission for your queen!" Iki yells after the retreating r=
ed-capped head.       Neri shudders. "Have I mentioned how much I hate it h=
ere?" She takes another step, and her foot catches in a root. "Ah!" Iki is =
the only reason she doesn't go spiraling forward.       Iki backpedals with=
 Neri clutched to her. "That was close!" She lets out a shaky breath. "I do=
n't want to be out here anymore."
      "Help me with my boot?" They struggle to get her foot free. When they=
 do, they hobble over to a tree where she sits against it. "It's all out of=
 whack now." She has to slip it off before managing to get it straightened =
out and back on her foot. Just as she zips up the side, the roots opened, a=
nd Neri sunk in between them. Down into darkness.       "Bad tree!" Iki gra=
bs a branch and pulls on it. "Let her go!"
      "IKIIIIII!" Her voice came out as an echo as she hits bottom. Neri mu=
tters, "I hate this place." She sits up and tilts her head to see gaps in t=
he rooted ceiling. Iki was doing her best to free them. "So weird..." She g=
ets to her knees, and just as she's about to stand, she catches sight of so=
mething. "I think I see something!" she calls up.       "What?" Iki calls b=
ack.       "I don't know yet," Neri calls. She crawls forward. "Please, don=
't eat me. Please, eat me," she begs as she nears what appeared to be a bun=
dled-up blanket. She carefully nudges it forward, and when she feels a lump=
 inside, she eases it closer. "Don't eat me, don't eat me." She pushes asid=
e the blanket and sees two big eyes looking up at her. Tiny ears were on ei=
ther side of its head with shapes that made her think of bat wings, its lit=
tle nose was button-shaped, and aside from that and the shape of the pupils=
, it looked like a human baby. "It's a baby!... I think." She's about to pi=
ck up when a bush lunges out at her, making her scream. It swings branches =
at her that were dotted with multicolored flowers, and as she dodged its hi=
ts, she caught sight of daisies that it was walking on like feet. "I'm not =
hurting anything!" She swings at the bush thing and knocks it aside. "Stop =
that, you tree!"
      "Leave!" The bush yells, whacking the intruder. "Not your baby!"
      "What's happening?" Iki calls. She releases the tree to try and peer =
through a hole in the ground at Neri. The ground opens up beneath her feet,=
 and she falls through where she then lands beside her friend.       "I'm n=
ot taking your baby!" Neri swats back at the bush. "Your baby shouldn't be =
down here anyway, and I hate to tell you this, but it looks nothing like yo=
u!"
      "My baby!" The bush screeches.       "What is happening?" Iki scrambl=
es to her hands and knees.       "It's a talking bush with a baby." Neri fi=
nds a stick and waves it at the bush. "Listen you. No more hitting!" She po=
kes at it. "Got it?"
      "Don't touch my baby!" The bush cries, taking hold of the stick.     =
  "Did I hit my head or something?" Iki asks, staring at the bush thing.   =
    "Look bush, I am not doing anything to the baby. Just talk like a ratio=
nal... plant." Neri shakes the stick with the bush thing on it. "Understood=
?"
      "We don't want to hurt your baby," Iki adds for good measure.       T=
he bush releases the stick. "Okay."
      "Why don't you just tell us why you're both down here. This baby does=
n't look like it has what it needs to eat," Neri says. "Can you be calm, no=
w?"
      "I saved it," the bush says, its flowers rustling with agitation. "It=
's my baby now."
      "Where did you find it?" Iki asks.       "It was crying..." the bush =
inches closer to the baby.       "And you found it..? Was it left by his pa=
rents? Did something bad happen to them?" Neri asks. She scoots aside so th=
e bush can get next to the baby.       "Parents dead," the bush says sadly.=
 It brushes its leaves across the baby's cheek.       "Dead?" A chill cours=
es down Iki's spine.       "This baby grows slow," the bush says, frustrati=
on in its voice. "I waited to go to queen and king, but too long."
      "What happened to the parents? Did someone kill them?" Neri didn't tr=
ust Alyvia with such delicate matters, but Alyn seemed trustworthy enough. =
      The bush bristles. "Enemies," it spits.       "Who are the enemies?" =
Iki pries, crawling closer. "Please, tell us. We want to help."
      Neri looks up at the rooted ceiling. "And if you could tell us how to=
 get out of here. That'd be super."
      "Don't touch," the bush warns, pointing at the two strangers. When th=
ey nod, it waddles over to the dirt wall and presses a foot daisy against i=
t. There's a light tremble as roots unearth themselves.       "I don't like=
 this," Iki gasps.       "Which part? The orphaned baby or the crazy bush o=
r the tree that ate us?" Neri whispers. "Thank you. How about you and the b=
aby come back with us? I have a manor that's part of the Court of Madness, =
and you'll be safe there."
      "All of the above, actually," Iki says after a moment's pause.       =
The bush crosses its arms. "You taking baby?"
      "And you," Neri assures. "Both of you. We can help you get the baby s=
ome food and shelter. You can protect it, and we can help. Sound good?"
      "Vow," the bush says.       Iki and Neri exchange glances. "We vow we=
 only want to help."
      Neri puts up a hand. "We promise." She carefully picks up the baby. "=
Shall we?"
      "How far does this tunnel lead?" Iki asks, getting to her feet.      =
 "Out of Wyldwood," the bush says.       "I'm so glad for that." Neri hugs =
the quiet bundle against her chest. "Lead the way?"
      "Stay close," the bush warns. It checks to make sure the baby is okay=
 before waddling into the tunnel.       "Your cousin owes us big time," Iki=
 says.--->=20

  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The discomfort inside the train I rode=
 that early Monday morning was unbelievable. Kaduna was my origin,&nbsp;Abu=
ja, the Federal Capital of Nigeria was my destination and an invitation to =
sleep during the ride was barely a few blinks away. It was only 6:30 a.m bu=
t tiredness was already waging a war against me, against my eyes. Noise fro=
m passengers on the overcrowded train was a blessing and a curse. A blessin=
g to keep me awake on this trip which was a first for me and a curse becaus=
e it prevented me from getting much needed rest. There was so much clutter =
of people's belongings along the aisle and luggage holds. Various things we=
re scattered here and there owned by some untidy passengers. This was simpl=
y an amalgam of people from usual and not so usual backgrounds, often of di=
fferent ethnicities and faiths cramped together on a trip.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I badly wanted to sleep since last nig=
ht was a nightmare in the most simplest terms. I woke up more than thrice i=
n last night, all tensed up and uneasy and then got up from bed as early as=
 4 a.m to prepare for my travel. The tension and stress about the job inter=
view I was going for in Abuja all bottled up inside of me. Maybe it was the=
 excitement of new possibilities or an apprehension of old challenges follo=
wing me like ghosts of my unsuccessful life. Getting this job would simply =
be a life changer for me as until now I had been underemployed and seeking =
new avenues to jumpstart a new career and life in a different location othe=
r than my native Kaduna state. My prospective job offer was that of a sales=
 representative for a mega telecom phone shop somewhere in the Central Busi=
ness District of Abuja and I had to be there by 9 a.m for the interview.</s=
pan></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">There were two co passengers I sat wit=
h, a beautiful plump lady next to me who was occupied with tending to her b=
aby's needs and a middle aged man seated at the far side. The man had an ex=
pressionless face that made me think he was in a world of his own filled wi=
th troubles. I could have named the infant with the lady, Restless, a boy t=
hat was probably six months old. He would whine, cry, scream or tug on his =
mother's blouse, apparently in some episode of baby tantrums. And in return=
 his mom would pat him on the back, give him a snack or scold him in a thre=
atening tone. I thought of engaging her in a conversation as a fellow woman=
 but decided against it when I glimpsed a frown on her face. She was now on=
 the phone talking in low tones to someone. A male voice could be heard on =
the other end and I thought it was either her husband, a boyfriend or just =
one guy she knew. It was only until she addressed the man beside her fondly=
 did I guess that he was probably her husband.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">My phone rang somewhere in the middle =
of the journey. The caller ID showed it was my mom.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Tamara, how is the journey? Hope=
 you ate well at the station before boarding the train?&quot; she said in a=
 tone that suggested I dare not respond in the negative.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I had called early that morning to gre=
et her. She was aware of my journey some days ago and had wished me a safe =
trip.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Yes, Ma. I ate well. But still n=
othing compares to your home cooked food, now.&quot; And that was the truth=
 sincerely. The food from the roadside vendors at the station wasn't all as=
 tasty and healthy as my mum's. But I couldn't complain much. On a trip lik=
e this you have to eat and be on the move. No time for sweet relishing of f=
ood.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Well if you say so, that is good=
 Make sure you take good care of yourself and phone me when you arrive in =
Abuja,&quot; she said sternly.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">She proceeded to reel out a list of ad=
vice, what I should do and not do when I arrived my destination.&nbsp;My mo=
ther was a strong pillar for me and during my struggles with university and=
 work she supported me in so many ways. It had been five years since I left=
 the tertiary institution and I had engaged in one menial job or the other =
to make ends meet. But now after six years I had gotten a call from a firm =
that I had applied to many months back and without any hesitation I left my=
 job as a waiter in Kaduna to go for the interview.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">After ending the call with my mom, my =
co passengers, the lady and man stood up, gathered up their baggage and wal=
ked down with difficulty to the end of the coach. It was no surprise, the t=
rain was full with as many passengers standing as those sitting down. They =
both sat somewhere on the steps leading to the exit door. A young guy about=
 my age who was standing by politely asked if he could sit beside me after =
the exit of the couple. He simply grabbed the chance for a seat before othe=
r people had noticed the available empty seats. I looked up at him, shrugge=
d and said yes.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Hi. I am Ben. What's your name?&=
quot; he asked with a pleasing masculine voice when he had settled down on =
the seat. Beside him on the last seat by the aisle was another guy who didn=
't seem to want to acknowledge my presence. I presumed that the unknown guy=
 was travelling with Ben.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Tamara, but you can call me Tamm=
y,&quot;&nbsp;I responded in the sweetest of my voices.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I began to wonder when last I&nbsp;hea=
rd such a strong, masculine voice that was also from a playful personality.=
 Maybe from Kiss Daniel, the singer or Kehinde my cheerful neighbor back in=
 Kaduna who would serenade the compound with his brilliant singing. Before =
long, Ben and I were into a nice conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He talked about his computer business =
that he had in Abuja which he started some years back. Initially his ambiti=
on from secondary school was to become a botanist but later on he studied p=
harmacy at the university after realizing there weren't many career opportu=
nities in that line in Nigeria. He told me his love for botany was kindled =
by a garden of flowers that an elderly couple from his hometown had kept. T=
hey had previously worked for some expatriate families in the big city of L=
agos before retiring back to Kaduna and replicating the gardens of their bo=
sses. He reached into his pocket and brought out a flower I couldn't recogn=
ize. Anyway I wasn't much of a flower expert.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Do you know that this couple bec=
ame famous for their stories of&nbsp;those foreign people they worked for? =
They would tell all their guests that came to visit them about their experi=
ences with foreigners from different countries. Some were American, British=
, Italian and a few Australians and they all had different lifestyles,&quot=
; he remarked.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;So tell me about yourself. Where=
 do you come from?&quot; He was flashing a captivating smile while turning =
the flower in his hand.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Kaduna but originally my</span><=
/p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">parents are from Niger state,&quot;&nb=
sp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I wasn't particularly comfortable arou=
nd guys who made it their business to pry about a lady's life but Ben seeme=
d different. His attitude was cool and unique, he didn't not have that over=
ly bearing attitude with me as I knew with some other guys. And gosh he col=
ogne was something out of this world.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Suddenly I thought the journey was tak=
ing longer than usual. I checked the time: 7:35 a.m showed on my phone. One=
 hour more in the train before I reach my destination. Now the urge to slee=
p was gone.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;So what are you doing today in A=
buja,&quot; he asked, bringing me back to the present from my thoughts.</sp=
an></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Oh, just visiting. But specifica=
lly to stay with a distant cousin who is into car repairs for a short time,=
&quot; I said in the most causal tone. I didn't want to mention that my mis=
sion was a job interview otherwise he may ask more questions. Questions I w=
asn't ready to hear from a stranger nor give answers to. The scenery was ch=
anging Ben said his eyes looking out from the window. But I didn't notice w=
hat he was seeing, my gaze was on my former co passengers who had now moved=
 again to a new seat.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Evergreen trees of oranges, mangoes, n=
eem, etc lined the railside. I thought of my life, how dry and grey it was,=
 much like the harmattan season that was worse in Kaduna and better in Abuj=
a. It was slowly easing paving way for the coming rainy season.</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;The trees are beautiful around t=
his place. It's completely different from Kaduna,&quot; I&nbsp;said despera=
te to move the focus off me by changing the topic of conversation.</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot; Yes. This side gets more rainfa=
ll than Kaduna.&quot; Ben said looking at his phone. &quot;We must be close=
 to Abuja now.&quot; He then turned to me and asked if this was my first ti=
me traveling to Abuja. I told him yes.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He smiled. &quot; I bet you will like =
Abuja more than Kaduna even if you are staying for a short time.&quot;</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Well, I will see about that. I p=
ersonally think everyplace in Nigeria is the same. Same problems, same chal=
lenges but maybe different people,&quot; I replied glancing at the trees an=
d vegetation moving by my window.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">He agreed but argued that there would =
always differences between people in one place or the other and the differe=
nt climates were to be reckoned with and not ignored. Climates in a country=
 may be the same or different but certainly not the people. There will alwa=
ys be personal preferences by one person or the other. Things that made peo=
ple struggle and others thrive. Ben stood up and told me it was time for hi=
m to leave. With my hand in his, he blew me a kiss before saying 'this is f=
or you' and disappeared down the aisle. When he had gone I looked down to m=
y hand and inside it was the flower Ben held earlier while we had talked. U=
ncertainty filled my mind, on one hand I desired for him to stay with me. F=
or us to chat our time away in fantasies and imaginations that may end up o=
nly in our heads and not in reality. Stories that may forever be bound only=
 by a trip on a train. On the other hand, I needed my space, my privacy, a =
desperate need to close old chapters of my life in Kaduna and open new and =
better ones in Abuja.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I moved back in the seat and brought t=
he blooming gift to my face. Closing my eyes, I deeply inhaled the sweet fr=
agrance of the flower. Just then I found myself in another world. This plac=
e was different, unfamiliar but yet pleasant and wonderful at least. I wond=
ered how I got there or what brought me. Was it magic, my silent wish or a =
kind gesture from a sympathetic person? Somebody who knew my struggles, pai=
n and concerns and was willing to give me a fresh start, an example of what=
 my future could be. The place I found myself looked somewhat like a garden=
 and was a world full of surprises and excitement. Surprises because this w=
as a strange environment that should make me want to escape, to flee the un=
known but yet exciting that it allured me, made me think of the possibiliti=
es out there for me. Under my feet was lush green grass, shimmering in the =
distance in the sunlight, there were pools of clear, blue water with agile =
fishes and water creatures and on surrounding bushes, trees and plants wher=
e numerous animals. They were moving around, flying effortlessly in the mos=
t breathtaking sights and in perfect harmony. Along a certain path I notice=
d some flower petals scattered on it almost covering the stone pavement and=
 what looked like a person's figure in the far distance. Instinctively,&nbs=
p;I headed down the path in curiosity and amazement following the trail of =
petals, and what I later discovered where shining stones that felt surprisi=
ngly soft on my sensitive feet. As I continued walking I suddenly felt ligh=
t and weightless. And in a flash I just realized that I was floating like f=
eather in the wind, like a bird or butterfly.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;I am glad you are here. How do y=
ou like this place?&quot; said a voice behind me. It sounded so familiar. I=
 turned my head unconsciously and behold a few feet away from me stood Ben.=
 Shock could have been an understatement to describe how I felt. And then, =
like a heavy load I felt like I was falling towards the ground. But just th=
en, Ben reached out and held me in his arms.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">'He has saved my life,' I thought in m=
y head.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">'HE SAVED ME!'&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I turned round to face him when we bot=
h had landed on the ground in the most relaxed manner and style.</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;Thank you. You saved me!&quot;</=
span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;You are welcome. But please next=
 time don't get shocked. It may spell doom for you.&quot;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The way he said those words suggested =
he probably wasn't angry with me or unhappy about the incident. Rather ther=
e was a look of concern in&nbsp;his eyes as he looked at me.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;So what brought you here?&quot; =
he asked.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&quot;I don't know. All I remember is =
that you gave me a flower on the train before you stood up to leave and whe=
n I inhaled the fragrance I came here through a passage.&quot;</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I looked at him excepting a reply of j=
oy and happiness. That he was as happy to see me as I was after our brief c=
onversation in the train. I wanted to know if he had any feelings for me, i=
f I made him feel different the same way he did to me. When we were seating=
 side by side, exchanging ideas and thoughts in our our own world of talkin=
g.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">But no he didn't. He simply said: come=
 No other word said or sound made. Instead he took me round on a tour of t=
he garden naming each flower, their botanical name like a rehearsed song of=
 history as long as the distance from the Earth to Mars.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">After awhile he said it was time</span=
></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">for me to go back; my journey of droug=
hts and unfruitfulness had ended. And a new chapter, a new season of freshn=
ess and showers was awaiting me.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">I was back in the train now. No longer=
 in the garden of flowers or magic, back to reality where I left it off. In=
 the train other passengers were lost in their thoughts, in their ideas and=
 plans. Maybe some came to Abuja to start a new life afresh like me, like s=
prouting seeds with the rains after a dry spell. A life hard to come by whe=
rever they were before.&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">It definitely will not be easy but sur=
ely my life will sprout again, be fresh and fruitful like the tropical fore=
sts in the southern part of Nigeria. Yes, I will not be suitable to live in=
 the deserts of the north, nor the swamps of the south plagued by floods. N=
o. I would not live in any of these areas for all the money in the world.&n=
bsp;I will thrive and survive beyond the reaches of extinction, an environm=
ent created to make me a nobody and invisible. I looked out the window reli=
shing maybe for the first time in my life the greenery I saw by the railtra=
ck fresh bursts of growth after a long harmattan. My impression of the beau=
tiful scenery of grass, shrubs and trees with bold backgrounds of hills and=
 rock formations was that of a good omen, portending new beginnings and suc=
cess for me. I thought to myself, if plants and wildlife can still be resil=
ient and beautiful in the face of unfavorable circumstances then why should=
n't I?</span></p>=20
  <p>&nbsp;</p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">In an age when Hindu majoritarianism h=
as divided India on communal lines, and Islamic radicalism is on the rise a=
cross the globe, a local goddess admired by both Hindus and Muslims shines =
a beacon of hope on what it means to be truly pluralistic.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;"><strong>Sundarbans</strong>&nbsp;was s=
pread across Jessore, Khulna, Barisal, Bakherganj and almost the entire par=
t of 24 Parganas between Hooghli and Meghna. In the study of folk culture m=
any folk goddesses are found there. One of them Dakshin Rai. The identity o=
f the Dakshin Rai, we know from the various sources that his father was, Da=
nda Baksha, who was the ruler of the ?Atharo Vatir Desh'. His mother was Na=
rayani. He was the ruler of Hijli. His residence in the Khania and his roya=
l palace was in khanri. The inhabitant of the sundarbans, imagined him as a=
 warrior. The people of this region also imagined him a forest god or as ti=
ger-god. He was also known as &quot;Bararai&quot; or man-eater tiger. In th=
e Sundarbans, Dakshin Rai and his followers, whose character as tiger also =
worshiped. There is a lot of controversy about Dakshin Rai, as the god of a=
ny religion. Many scholars and researchers believe that in the primitive so=
ciety, there was a tradition of worship of the Tiger as a man in Astro-mang=
oloid group.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Perhaps nothing reflects the long hist=
ory of Hindu-Muslim unity in the country than the story of Bonbibi, a local=
 Goddess worshipped by both Hindus and Muslims in the dense forest of the S=
undarbans in West Bengal. Her Hindu followers call her Bandurga, Bandevi or=
 Banbibi and her predominantly Hindu images are found as wearing a crown an=
d garland, carrying a club and trishul. Her vahana (vehicle) is a tiger. He=
r Muslim followers call her Banbibi, and her predominantly Muslim images ar=
e found with braided hair, wearing a cap with a&nbsp;<em>tikli</em>. Instea=
d of a sari, she wears a ghagra and pyjama, and a pair of shoes.</span></p>=
=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">The word ?<em>ban</em>' in Bengali mea=
ns ?<em>forest</em>', while ?<em>bibi</em>' originates from the Persian wor=
d for lady or wife. The word ?<em>Bonbibi</em>' thus literally means ?<em>l=
ady of the forest</em>'. She is an Islamic deity,&nbsp;which is almost an o=
xymoron according to Islam and is believed to have travelled on Allah's ord=
ers from Medina to the Sundarbans to protect its distressed residents.</spa=
n></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">According to folklore, found in the ei=
ghteenth-century text ?Bonbibir Johuranama',&nbsp;Bonbibi was the daughter =
of Ibrahim, a fakir who came from Mecca and became the king of the Sundarba=
ns.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Since he had no children from his firs=
t wife, Phoolbibi, he married another woman Golabibi who gave birth to twin=
s: Bonbibi and Shah Junglee. Because Ibrahim has promised his first wife, h=
e would abandon the second child; he left Golabibi in the woods when she wa=
s pregnant. This is where Bonbibi was born and raised as a Muslim.</span></=
p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Years later, in the jungle, the brothe=
r-sister duo goes on to win a fierce battle with the evil lord Dakshin Ray =
who takes the form of the tiger and his mother, Narayani. Since then, Bonbi=
bi became the protector of forests and is especially revered by honey colle=
ctors and woodcutters who pray to Bonbibi before entering the Sundarbans to=
 seek protection.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;"><strong>Sundarban</strong>&nbsp;is the=
 only context where a deity is worshipped not only as a prerequisite of a c=
ustom but because of need, the need to gain confidence and courage before e=
ntering the forest. It is precisely because of this collective pursuit of p=
rotection, that Bonbibi, despite being a Muslim deity, transcends communal =
barriers and is worshipped by all the forest workers irrespective of caste =
and creed.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">For the islanders, Bonbibi goes agains=
t the distinctions of caste, class and religion. This is the reason why tho=
se who work in the forest as fishers and crabcollectors stress the fact tha=
t they have to consider all jatis ? whether Brahmin or Malo, rich or poor, =
Hindu or Muslim, or even human or animal ? ?equal'. Tigers and humans ?shar=
e the same food', they explain, because they both depend on the forest ? ti=
gers eat fish and crabs like the villagers, and like them, tigers are greed=
y for wood. These facts not only make tigers equal to humans but it also ?t=
ies' them to humans.Also, Dakshin Rai, the Ghazi and Bonbibi have to be pla=
ced together in shrines, point out the villagers, to show how different jat=
is and must coexist and come to an agreement when dealing with the forest. =
Many Sundarbans islanders say that the most important factor for ensuring t=
heir safety in the forest, apart from entering the forest ?empty handed' an=
d ?pure hearted', is that they should entrust their lives to Bonbibi, live =
up to her injunctions and not dwell on their differences.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">We realized man is the greatest predat=
or in the Sundarbans. Often on the river banks, we saw small makeshift huts=
 or brick structures with a red cloth flying over it. It was a Ban Bibir Th=
an or Temple.&nbsp;Ban Bibi or Bandevi is the guardian of the forest. Accor=
ding to folk lore,when the first human settlers could not cope with the Tig=
er God Dakshin Rai, and his army of wild animals and demons of the forest, =
they prayed to Bon Devi or Bon Durga or Bon Bibi. Bon Bibi defeated Dakshin=
 Rai and established her supremacy over the forest and protects her followe=
rs. Bon Bibi decked in red sari and crown, rides on a tiger and is revered =
by Hindus and Muslims alike in the Sundarbans.&nbsp;<em>No fisherman or Hon=
ey collector known as mouli will go to the deep Jungle to catch fish or col=
lect honey without offering prayer before Bon Bibi.</em>&nbsp;Bon Bibi Puja=
 is an annual function in the Sundarbans. Formerly Zamindars used to sponso=
r these festivals. Just in front of the&nbsp;<em>Kachari Bari of BoroTushka=
l</em>. Each would offer prayer to Bon Bibi and some would also offer some =
candle or&nbsp;<em>batasha</em>&nbsp;as offerings.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">For centuries, the region has been syn=
onymous with terrifying beasts, among them crocodiles, sharks and snakes, b=
ut tigers have loomed largest. The 9th-century Pala Dynasty inscriptions re=
fer to a ?forested seashore infested with tigers?. In the mid-1600s, French=
 physician-traveller Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier noted how they swam from islan=
d to island and suggested that boats should be tethered at a distance from =
shore because tigers were apt to skulk aboard and carry away sleeping sailo=
rs, usually the ?stoutest and fattest?.</span></p>=20
  <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">Just as we the human have the right to=
 live on planet earth, and so does the tigers, the crocodiles , and so does=
 the each and every creature.</span></p>=20
