The Q Interview with Tom Power | 'Listen to my side': Adele opens up about =
30, divorce and her struggle with fame
https://newsletters.cbc.ca/c/1fn80LR0sxZsCt2mEikkkUFMbAj

The lead-up to Adele's long-awaited album, 30, was by the singer's own acco=
unt "a big deal." In the six years since she released her last record, she =
almost completely disappeared from the public eye, so being thrust back int=
o the spotlight took some adjustment at first.

"I don't like being famous," she told Q's Tom Power in a Canadian exclusive=
 interview about 30, which is out now. "It's just hard to get used to, you =
know, everyone talking about me again, really."

Fuelling the current conversation around Adele are highly personal topics, =
such as her weight loss, her battle with anxiety and her divorce from entre=
preneur Simon Konecki, with whom she shares a son named Angelo, 9.
