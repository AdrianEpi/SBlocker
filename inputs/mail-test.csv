SPAM,        <http://g.expotavrida.com/?n>     Learning is a gift. Even when pain is your teacher.    Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree; you still believe it to be a beautiful place.    Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.    When we are no longer able to change a situation; we are challenged to change ourselves.      Best Regards

SPAM,        <http://vielitlimol.tk/xuco>     If you can dream it; then you can achieve it. You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.    When we are no longer able to change a situation; we are challenged to change ourselves.    Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable; or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.    All you can change is yourself; but sometimes that changes everything!      Best Regards

SPAM,            As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $717 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1LygPTbNxFr3RzoBRzwBifQXmE7sCZwM9p   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!

SPAM,        Hello!   I have very bad news for you. 15/02/2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org   So; you can change the password; yes... But my malware intercepts it every time.   How I made it: In the software of the router; through which you went online; was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online; my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.   After that; I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book; history of viewing sites; all files; phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).   A month ago; I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit; and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults.   I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!   And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about; huh?).

SPAM,        Hello!   I have very bad news for you. 12/03/2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org   So; you can change the password; yes... But my malware intercepts it every time.   How I made it: In the software of the router; through which you went online; was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online; my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.   After that; I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book; history of viewing sites; all files; phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).   A month ago; I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit; and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults.   I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!   And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about; huh?).

SPAM,            From:Miss: Fatima Yusuf.   For sure this mail would definitely come to you as a surprise; but do take your good time to go through it; My name is Ms. Fatima Yusuf;i am from Ivory Coast.   I lost my parents a year and couple of months ago. My father was a serving director of the Agro-exporting board until his death. He was assassinated by his business partners.Before his death; he made a deposit of US$9.7 Million Dollars here in Cote d'ivoire which was for the purchase of cocoa processing machine and development of another factory before his untimely death.   Being that this part of the world experiences political and crises time without number; there is no guarantee of lives and properties. I cannot invest this money here any long; despite the fact it had been my late father's industrial plans.   I want you to do me a favor to receive this funds into your country or any safer place as the beneficiary; I have plans to invest this money in continuation with the investment vision of my late father; but not in this place again rather in your country. I have the vision of going into real estate and industrial production or any profitable business venture.   I will be ready to compensate you with 20% of the total Amount; now all my hope is banked on you and i really wants to invest this money in your country; where there is stability of Government; political and economic welfare.   My greatest worry now is how to move out of this country because my uncle is threatening to kill me as he killed my father;Please do not let anybody hear about this; it is between me and you alone because of my security reason.   I am waiting to hear from you. Yours Sincerely; Miss.Fatima Yusuf.

I will endorse your name in the deceased client file here in my office which will indicate to that the deceased is your legal joint account business partner or family member next of kin to the deceased and officially the bank will transfer the fund to your bank account within seven working days in accordance to our banking inheritance rules and fund claim regulation.   I will share 40% for you and 60% for me after the fund is transferred to your bank account; we need to act fast to complete this transaction within seven days.

Here in Syria we are not allowed to go out that makes it very bored for me so I just think I need a friend to talk to outside to keep me going. I would love to get to know the "real" you as a friend.   Respectfully;   James bergner  
SPAM,        Greetings My Dear;       I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Ruby Williams  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr Williams Carlsen; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (eleven million dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm takingthis decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Ruby Williams.

SPAM,        Hi; dear user of untroubled.org   We have installed one RAT software into you device  For this moment your email account is hacked too.   Changed your password? You're doing great! But my software recognizes every such action. I'm updating passwords! I'm always one step ahead....   So... I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence. The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.   I posted EternalBlue Exploit modification on porn site; and then you installed my malicious code (trojan) on your operation system. When you clicked the button Play on porn video; at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device. After installation; your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate; in addition; the software is synchronized with the video you choose.   For the moment; the software has harvrested all your contact information from social networks and email addresses. If you need to erase all of your collected data and video with your enjoy; send me $600(usd) in BTC (crypto currency).   This is my Bitcoin wallet: 1A19CzQQ5ZFxK57LWoAn2rFScTda6DnK1q You have 48 hours after reading this letter.   After your transaction I will erase all your data. Otherwise; I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues; friends and relatives!!!   P.S. I'm asking you - not to answer this letter because the sender's address is fake; just to keep me incognito.   And henceforth be more careful! Please visit only secure sites! Bye;Bye...

SPAM,        I greet you!   I have bad news for you. 11/06/2019 - on this day I hacked your operating system and got full access to your account bruceg@untroubled.org   It is useless to change the password; my malware intercepts it every time.   How it was: In the software of the router to which you were connected that day; there was a vulnerability. I first hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you entered in the Internet; my trojan was installed on the operating system of your device.   After that; I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book; history of viewing sites; all files; phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).   A month ago; I wanted to lock your device and ask for a small amount of money to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit; and came to the big delight of your favorite resources. I'm talking about sites for adults.   I want to say - you are a big pervert. You have unbridled fantasy!   After that; an idea came to my mind. I made a screenshot of the intimate website where you have fun (you know what it is about; right?). After that; I took off your joys (using the camera of your device). It turned out beautifully; do not hesitate.   I am strongly belive that you would not like to show these pictures to your relatives; friends or colleagues. I think $763 is a very small amount for my silence. Besides; I spent a lot of time on you!   I accept money only in Bitcoins. My BTC wallet: 1PKQvF9qK3zuB8KVwmDVDUxtpUVfE1P6fp   You do not know how to replenish a Bitcoin wallet? In any search engine write "how to send money to btc wallet". It's easier than send money to a credit card!   For payment you have a little more than two days (exactly 50 hours). Do not worry; the timer will start at the moment when you open this letter. Yes; yes .. it has already started!   After payment; my virus and dirty photos with you self-destruct automatically. Narrative; if I do not receive the specified amount from you; then your device will be blocked; and all your contacts will receive a photos with your "joys".   I want you to be prudent.

This money belongs to one of our bank client; a Libyan oil exporter who was working with the former Libyan government; I learn t that he was killed by the revolutionary forces since October 2011. Our bank is planning to transfer this entire fund into the government public treasury as unclaimed fund if nobody comes to claim the money from our bank after four years without account activities .   We did not know each other before; but due to the fact that the deceased is a foreigner; the bank will welcome any claim from a foreigner without any suspect; that is why I decided to look for someone whim I can trust to come and claim the fund from our bank.   I will endorse your name in the deceased client file here in my office which will indicate to that the deceased is your legal joint account business partner or family member next of kin to the deceased and officially the bank will transfer the fund to your bank account within seven working days in accordance to our banking inheritance rules and fund claim regulation.   I will share 40% for you and 60% for me after the fund is transferred to your bank account; we need to act fast to complete this transaction within seven days. I will come to your country to collect my share after the fund is transferred to your bank account in your country. I hope that you will not disappoint me after the fund is transferred to your bank account in your country.   Please I want you to send me your private phone number so that I can call you to discuss more details on how we can proceed on this project   Waiting for your urgent response today Yours sincerely   Kone Compaore

SPAM,            My dearest in the Lord;   Greetings to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was after going t= hrough your profile that i am moved to contact you with this important issu= e with faith and confidence that you will be of good assistant to this work=  of God. Firstly let me introduce myself to you. I'm Mrs. Isabella Dzsesszi= ka from Kuwait. I was married to Mr. Mseswa Dzsesszika; Who worked with the=  Kuwaiti embassy in C=C3=B4te d'Ivoire for 15 years before death in 2010?   We were married for 13 years without a child. He died after a brief illness=  that lasted only four days. Before his death; we were both strong believer= s. Since his death I have decided not to remarry or have a child out of my = marriage home that the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive; he=  deposited the amount of $ 1.5 Million in a bank here in Abidjan the econom= ic capital of Ivory Coast's. Currently; my doctor has confirmed that I have=  serious illness that is cancer problem.   What disturbs me most is my stroke. Haven has met my condition. I have deci= ded to donate this fund to a church or individual who will use this money i= n the manner I am going to instruct here. I want a person or church that wi= ll use this fund for orphanages; helping the widows; propagating the word o= f God And to Endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made u= s understand that the hand that gives is blessed; I made this decision beca= use I have no child who will inherit this money and my husband's relatives = are unbelievers and I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbeli= evers.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. = That is why I am making this decision. I'm not afraid of death because I kn= ow where I'm going. I know that I will be in the Lord's bosom. Exodus 14 VS=  14 says that you will fight my case and I will keep my peace; As soon as I=  receive your reply; I will give you the more details regarding thefund and=  how it will quickly transfer to you without delay. I want you to always pr= ay for me. My happiness is that I have lived a life of a worthy Christian. = Whoever wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth.   Please always be sincere throughout your life. Any delay in your response w= ill give me room in sourcing another church or individual for this same pur= pose. Please assure me that you will act according to what I said here.   Waiting to receive your reply.   Remain blessed in the Lord. Yours sister; Ms. Isabella Dzsesszika

He originally sought a career in law; attending Williams College where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity; and Fordham University law school. Though he became a law clerk after his graduation; making as much in a month of radio as he did in a year of clerking convinced him to make broadcasting his career; changing his surname and becoming a familiar voice on all three major radio networks by 1940.   He held starring or major supporting roles in The Man I Married (as Adam Waring); Kate Hopkins; Angel of Mercy (as Tom); Pretty Kitty Kelly (as Michael Conway); Terry and the Pirates (as Pat Ryan); Renfrew of the Mounted (as Renfrew); and Abie's Irish Rose (as Abie Levy). He also was the announcer for a number of radio soap operas; including The Guiding Light and The Goldbergs. Superman Main article: Superman (franchise)   Collyer's best-remembered radio starring role began in early 1940 in The Adventures of Superman on the Mutual Broadcasting System; a role he also performed in the subsequent Superman cartoons. Collyer supplied the voices of both Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent; opposite radio actress Joan Alexander as Lois Lane. Every Superman episode featured a scene in which Clark Kent changed into his Superman costume; an effect which Collyer conveyed by shifting voices while speaking the phrase "This is (or "looks like") a job for Superman!" his voice always dropping when becoming Superman.

SPAM,        Dear Friend;   Greetings to you in the name of God; I=E2=80=99m Mrs Awuta Mamma and I have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that I have just few days to leave. I from (Paris) France; but based in Africa Burkina Faso since eight years ago as a business woman dealing with gold exportation and cotton Sales. Now that I am about to end the race like this; without any family members and no child; I have $5.8 Million US Dollars in here in Burkina Faso in the BANK; already I have instructed the Bank to give St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest; because I am afraid they may not do so and sit upon the money if I died; It is the reason why I order them to stop and wish to contact you now through the help of a nurse with computer beside my sick bed. I have instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as a foreigner; that will apply to the bank after I have gone that they should release the fund to you; but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the fund and give 50% to the orphanages home in your country for my heart to rest in peace. Respond to me immediately for further details since I have just few days to end my life due to the ovarian cancer disease; hoping you will understand my situation and give favorable attention. Thank you and God bless you;   Mrs Awuta Mamma

SPAM,        I'AM SUFFERING FROM CANCER OF THE HEART     Dear Friend.     Greetings to you in the name of the Lord God Almighty am MRS. NICOLE MAROIS From (Paris) France; but am based in Burkina Faso Africa for eight years now as a business woman dealing on gold exportation and cotton Sales. But I have been suffering from this deadly disease called cancer for long and the doctor just said I have just few days to leave. I know it will be difficult for you to believe my story now; but this is the situation I found myself in; it=E2=80=99s not my desire to =   on a sick bed today but God knows best;   Now that I am about to end the race like this; without any family Members and no child. I have $5.8 Million US DOLLARS in BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) Burkina Faso it=E2=80=99s all my life savings; I instructed the Ban=   to give it to St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest because i do not trust them; I am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick bed.   I will instruct the bank to transfer this fund to you as a foreigner but you have to promise me that you will take 40 Percent(%) of the total money for your personal use While 60 Percent (%) of the money will go to charity; Orphanages and less Privileges" people in the street and helping the Needed. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member; just to Endeavour that the house of God is maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because these sicknesses have suffered me so much.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank and I will also instruct my Bank Manger to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.     I look forward to getting a reply from you.   Thanks and God bless you;   MRS Mrs NICOLE MAROIS.

In Domesday (1086) the city of York was divided into shires. The first shires of Scotland were created in English-settled areas such as Lothian and the Borders; in the ninth century. King David I more consistently created shires and appointed sheriffs across lowland shores of Scotland.   The shire in early days was governed by an ealdorman and in the later Anglo-Saxon period by royal official known as a "shire reeve" or sheriff. The shires were divided into hundreds or wapentakes; although other less common sub-divisions existed. An alternative name for a shire was a "sheriffdom" until sheriff court reforms separated the two concepts. The phrase "shire county" applies; unofficially; to non-metropolitan counties in England; specifically those that are not local unitary authority areas. In Scotland the word "county" was not adopted for the shires. Although "county" appears in some texts; "shire" was the normal name until counties for statutory purposes were created in the nineteenth century.

SPAM,        Howdy;   What if I told you about garden that needs to digging; no watering and no weeding AND it can grow in the most extreme places on earth?       This type of "food forest" grows on auto-pilot with minimal energy because it mimics how nature works. No one is watering the woods; yet every plants has managed to survive for thousands of years there.   Start your very own survival garden that's 100% concealed from prying eyes and stay well-fed in case of any kind of long-term disaster.

It was after going t= hrough your profile that i am moved to contact you with this important issu= e with faith and confidence that you will be of good assistant to this work=  of God. Firstly let me introduce myself to you. I'm Mrs. Isabella Dzsesszi= ka from Kuwait. I was married to Mr. Mseswa Dzsesszika; Who worked with the=  Kuwaiti embassy in C=C3=B4te d'Ivoire for 15 years before death in 2010?   We were married for 13 years without a child. He died after a brief illness=  that lasted only four days. Before his death; we were both strong believer= s. Since his death I have decided not to remarry or have a child out of my = marriage home that the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive; he=  deposited the amount of $ 1.5 Million in a bank here in Abidjan the econom= ic capital of Ivory Coast's. Currently; my doctor has confirmed that I have=  serious illness that is cancer problem.   What disturbs me most is my stroke. Haven has met my condition. I have deci= ded to donate this fund to a church or individual who will use this money i= n the manner I am going to instruct here. I want a person or church that wi= ll use this fund for orphanages; helping the widows; propagating the word o= f God And to Endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made u= s understand that the hand that gives is blessed; I made this decision beca= use I have no child who will inherit this money and my husband's relatives = are unbelievers and I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by unbeli= evers.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. = That is why I am making this decision. I'm not afraid of death because I kn= ow where I'm going. I know that I will be in the Lord's bosom. Exodus 14 VS=  14 says that you will fight my case and I will keep my peace; As soon as I=  receive your reply; I will give you the more details regarding thefund and=  how it will quickly transfer to you without delay. I want you to always pr= ay for me. My happiness is that I have lived a life of a worthy Christian. = Whoever wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth.   Please always be sincere throughout your life. Any delay in your response w= ill give me room in sourcing another church or individual for this same pur= pose. Please assure me that you will act according to what I said here.   Waiting to receive your reply.   Remain blessed in the Lord. Yours sister; Ms. Isabella Dzsesszika

SPAM,            Good day;   You were recommended by a mutual associate. I write you regarding an investment of bearer bonds I made on behalf of a client.           The investment was made in 2009 and has been under my management. The said investor is deceased. The window is now available to assign these bonds to any name or company of my choice. I have all the necessary information to achieve this within 10 banking days.               The total value of the bond is 100million pounds sterling; in a million pound denominations.                If you can handle this; do contact me at your earliest convenience via my email christopherwang36@gmail.com So we can discuss the final details Thank you.   Mr CHRISTOPHER WANG

In the past;  I have prepared lots of PDF manuals with only screenshots and photos and  without any text explanation. You can search for all of my PDF manuals  on my blogs. The links to my RAID 1 mirroring redundant blogs are:   https://tdtemcerts.blogspot.sg https://tdtemcerts.wordpress.com   I placed an order for my SGD$157 refurbished Fortigate 60D firewall  appliance on 1st August 2020 Saturday at 7:47 PM Singapore Time. The  seller is in Japan. I must say that FedEx international shipping from  Japan to Singapore is very fast. I received my Fortigate 60D firewall  appliance in Singapore on 4th August 2020 Tuesday at 12 noon Singapore  Time. It took only 4 days for my Fortigate 60D to be shipped from Japan  to Singapore.   Fortigate firewall appliances are based on the Linux Kernel and open  source software.

SPAM,        Do THIS 1 hour before bed to pee out stubborn fat in the morning:   Recent studies are now showing how a simple tweak to your bedtime ritual can have dramatic effects in shrinking fat tissue while reversing the signs of premature biological aging every time you fall asleep.

Please if you would be able to use this fund for God's work kindly reply me. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank; I will also send application letter to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.

SPAM,        To My Fitness Novices;     I shared this simple 7 second ritual with one of my clients a couple of month ago.    She had been struggling with her weight pretty much all her life.    And seemed to be stuck in a perpetual limbo of weight loss; weight gain; weight loss; weight gain. . .    But when she started doing THIS '7 second daily ritual' things rapidly changed. . .    She had fast fat loss from her hips; thighs face and arms.    While enjoying an increase in energy and zest for life.    She also had a youthful glow to her skin that she hadn't seen in years.      >> Try This Simple 7 Second Daily Ritual For Yourself Here   Hope this helps you too.    I'm confident it will!

SPAM,        Hi!    Unfortunately; I have some bad news for you. Several months ago; I got access to the device you are using to browse the internet. Since that time; I have been monitoring your internet activity.    Being a regular visitor of adult websites; I can confirm that it is you who is responsible for this.  To keep it simple; the websites you visited provided me with access to your data.    I've uploaded a Trojan horse on the driver basis that updates its signature several times per day; to make it impossible for antivirus to detect it. Additionally; it gives me access to your camera and microphone. Moreover; I have backed-up all the data; including photos; social media; chats and contacts.    Just recently; I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen; while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!    Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks; and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.    With that in mind; here is my proposal:  Transfer the amount equivalent to 1500 USD to my Bitcoin wallet; and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.    In my opinion; this is a somewhat modest price for my work.  You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing; seeing that it's not very difficult.   My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 16EuKQaCEEeba1Us68P9RwKjc8HTT4zWRR   You have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:    It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically. It makes no sense to complain either; since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.  Everything has been orchestrated precisely.    If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared; and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that; the video will be posted on the web!   P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).   Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck; next time please be careful.

SPAM,        Greetings My Dear;       I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Francisca  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (eleven million dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death; so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Francisca Carlsen

At agriculture sites in the Appalachian Mountains; intensive farming practices have caused erosion at up to 100x the natural rate of erosion in the region. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both "on-site" and "off-site" problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse; both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases; this leads to desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies; as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined; they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land; making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide.:2:1   Intensive agriculture; deforestation; roads; anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However; there are many prevention and remediation practices that can curtail or limit erosion of vulnerab

SPAM,        OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE; FALOMO; IKOYI. LAGOS - NIGERIA.     YOUR KIND ATTN.;       RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.   I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail; if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics; I apologize in advance.   I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law); I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd); my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime; presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village.   The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security adviser to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has decided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit.   I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in my possession.   The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million; Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you; you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.   I remain most obliged.

SPAM,        It was the Spring of 1979.     I was just a tall; goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the cafeteria; I walked from table to table ...   Stealing other kids' lunch money.   No; I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today;" I said; "and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment was too good to pass up; and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course  when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash; I promised to pay them even more the week after that; if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.   Eventually the end of the year came and went; high school started and with it came girls; and homework; and parties; and sports; and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.   I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid; and I didn't even get beat up.   Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.   First of all; greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week; so cash out when you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.   Second; never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money; not yours.   The "professionals"; those stuffy investment counselors and money managers; will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to those guys; the longer you keep your money in the market; the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "NEVER".     In a sense; they are right.  If you put $250;000 in an index fund right now; you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:   Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?   Hell no!   You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years; what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?     The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.   If your goal is to make quick profits in the market; volatility is your ally; and stability your enemy.  You want to see those large upswings; two hundred points in a day; followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the  money.   What I'm talking about here is day trading.     My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.    The day trader buys or sells 5;000 shares of XYZ for a $25;000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly; taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock; and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours; sometimes within minutes.     I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science; and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.   Society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.     The truth is; wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.     Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.   They make their money only if you believe two lies:   1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.   2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.   Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely; positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...   The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.     After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade; and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market; I've learned the following lessons:   ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.   ** Anyone can do it.   ** It only takes a few hours to learn.   When I discovered the secret to day trading; I didn't become wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash; drive to Wal-mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun; and rob your local bank. The  only way to get rich; quick or otherwise; is through hard work; knowledge; and determination.   After learning the fundamentals of day trading; I started  practicing the trading art itself; and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living; and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no  formal financial training; minimal effort and only moderate risk; I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained  during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book; the Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes; and from my successes; as I teach you the simple; secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year.   The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands; even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge; and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.    Average Income of a Day Trader:  5% average an income in excess of $500;000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250;000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100;000 per year.  27% average an income between $50;000 and $99;999 per year  11% average an income between $20;000 and $49;999 per year    After reading the Master Trader; you will discover extremely  profitable; simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win DESPITE the current market weakness.    Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:   *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.     *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.     *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade; the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them.      *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make.     *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market!      *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success.      *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.     *** Make money on the biggest news stories.     *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns.      *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street  professionals use.     *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.      It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the  Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am I going to take control of my own financial future; and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"   Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker; or yourself?   With the Master Trader e-book; you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars.   The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight-forward book ever written about active  trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future.   Oh; and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market.     Six years later; he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH.  Oops; they weren't laughing anymore.   In a rollercoaster market like we have today; day trading is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5% a year; then by all means; this ain't your kind of game.   But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market; with the lowest element of risk; then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.   You don't need to know anything about the market; and anyone can do it; with minimum effort.  It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

Ne retko se poslednjih dana; u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic; i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju; vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.         Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke; stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.         Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije; najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju; Slobodanu Milosevicu.         Po clanstvu partije; ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije; oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina; kada su shvatili da im je ;;odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.         Mladi socijalisti; kojih i nema bas mnogo; kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio; izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima; mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica; i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista; clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.          Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi; medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni; nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.          Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista; se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih; koji su takodje na strani predsednika.           Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic; svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica; danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.          Cak se poslednjih dana cuje; da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba; da se povezu rodbinskim vezama; pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda; Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica; predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije; koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia; svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni; jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih; a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a; za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu; mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.           Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje; no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.           Pimato se samo; sta ce da rade; ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?               _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4

HAM,        >  in adding cream to spaghetti carbonara; which has the same effect on pasta as >  making a pizza a deep-pie;    I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask  what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a  recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it  works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe  for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream; eggs and lots of fresh parmesan)  except for the creme fraiche.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.   (Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD; only to be told three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)   FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other. Expect Red Hat Solaris 11 any time now... <grin>

HAM,        what takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh; it's silly to spend $.37 (+ labor and materials) for a $.02 refund; but maybe the only alternative right now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.   in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the customer.  If it's less; the combined total amount will go to the city as lump sum settlement.   in your case; maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like their lump sum to go.  of courese; they'd have to be notified by mail first.

Mark David Chapman; 47; was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing; he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting; Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just "a picture on an album cover" to him before the shooting. 'Deserved death' Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if Chapman were released. Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. The Beatles front man; peace campaigner; and all-round iconoclast; would have been 62 on Wednesday.

HAM,        The Electronic Telegraph    Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far  (Filed: 28/08/2002)       So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone; bored with Birmingham  or sick of Sheffield.    Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey  this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps  heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.    Kommersant; a Russian daily newspaper; yesterday offered those dissatisfied  with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to  emigrate to provincial Russia.    After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons; its tongue-in-cheek  article admitted; however; that the grass was not always greener on the other  side.    "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city  deep in the provinces where things are quiet;" said Kommersant.    "In any central Russian district; life; by British standards; is unseemingly  cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are  becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."    The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of  tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.    It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the  famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also  opening time in the nation's vodka shops.    And the vodka; like all other spirits; is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that  "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be  enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their  life.    "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle  of whisky for kopecks."    There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a  halfpenny in sterling.    The whisky is cheap; however; because it is unlike anything the average Briton  will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled; moonshine  vodka - coloured with tea; and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among  diehard alcoholics.    While alcohol is plentiful and cheap; food may not be so easy to come by. The  newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail  soup as an example - were in short supply. However; the wealth of the British  settler should overcome the difficulty.    "For a modest reward in most Russian villages; the locals would happily cut  off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."    One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There  are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the  Mongolian border.    However; Kommersant pointed out; language difficulties were not considered a  deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in  which they would like to live.    France; the Russian paper claimed; was a country "where English is only known  by the beggars; Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".    Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle; the Russian  weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.    Even in the most temperate regions; winter temperatures of -20C are common.  And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place  in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures  that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the  permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.    Again; the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the  climatic problems; it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will  solve itself".    Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in  Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.    "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33  million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found  amongst our citizens."    Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians; however; not one of those Britons  surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their  preferred new home.

HAM,            I've got an normal 3.5" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with a Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this; for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM or floppy drive is normally).   There is also the possibility of using a docking station; but Dell's docking solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE drive; only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a "non-Dell" solution that's compatible.   Anyone any ideas?   Thanks;   Darren.

HAM,        Hello folks! I'm new to Linux; so here goes... I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem. I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18. I've got this Win-Modem(yes; I know) and managed to locate a proper driver for it. Minicom is very much able to dial out. But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation. When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal; all I get (after the initial info of my dynamic IP; etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal. Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat. I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script somewhere). It dials; it connects; it sends my username & password; and when connection is established; it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits. This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection; me friend tried connecting and as soon as he did; pppd exited.   Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of having to reboot; get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to Linux; mounting this drive to get that file; etc.  It'd be nice never have to go back to Windoze(except for games; that is).

HAM,        http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm     Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record numbers; a monitoring group has claimed.  The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of animals including pumas; black panthers; leopards and so-called Fen tigers over the past 12 months.    And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy; it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.     Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the critics and doubters; adding: "I was a sceptic; I thought it was in the same realm as the Loch Ness monster.    "But it's not; they are really out there."    'Cats with cubs'    Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country.    Big cat reports   Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire  January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx  November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat  April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London  1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales   "This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales; the Scottish borders; Kent; the West Midlands; Devon; Somerset and Wiltshire;" he said.    The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals.    But Mr Bamping said others; particularly lynx and puma; probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves.    "We have had sightings of cats with cubs;" he added.    'Trigger camera'    The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence; including photographs; paw prints; sheep kills and hair samples.    But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story.    A national "trigger camera" project is planned which; the society hopes; will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats.    Mr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself."    'Like dogs'    The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild; or their descendants.    Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s; people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs.    "But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force; people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence; put them down; or take them to a zoo."

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer; but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile process; and include all sorts of symbols/functions e.g. "#include <math.h>" gives you maths type functions.  Since they start with "#" they are ignored in the final compilation.   Regarding the rest of the compile process; you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source.  I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag     --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4 which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this is the right way to proceed.   Alternatively; maybe the steps above regarding "make dep" and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions.h & Co.   I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done); then you would have to move all those *.ver files; after that; there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h) files.  This could be quickly done; but is probably bad (those files don't really belong there).   For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation.         > Also; when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make"; I noticed > that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h > file.

Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer games; and dropping out of school and traditional group activities; becoming uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.   "Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore;" said Kim Hyun Soo; a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction Treatment Center; one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with Internet game addiction. "Young people are losing the ability to relate to others; except through games. People who become addicted are prone to violence; even when they are not playing.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of Trillian; v0.73; is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the computer.   Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ; AOL Instant Messenger; MSN Messenger; Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single interface; despite some companies actively avoiding messenger interoperability.   According to Jason Ross; senior analyst at amr interactive; in June 2002 there were 28;000 home users of Trillian in Australia; about 0.4 percent of the Internet population; and 55;000 people using it at work; about 1.8 percent of the Internet population.   David Banes; regional manager of Symantec security response; told ZDNet Australia the code appeared to be valid.   "With these sort of things you have to find some process that would accept a connection; then throw loads of random data at it and get it to crash;" he said. "Once it's crashed; you can try to find a way to exploit it."   He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on Notepad; but could be easily modified to run any program on the system. He said the problem was easy to fix by "writing protective code around that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that piece."   "Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the checks and balances you should put in; which is why we have all these buffer overflows and exploits out there now;" said Banes.   Cerulean Studios; creator of Trillian; was contacted for comment but had not responded by the time of publication.

Seems like every CD player should include the capability to rip; encode; and cache the last few CDs  inserted.    Playback would then never need to face seek delays...  after the initial ripping; the only use of the laser  pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted -- which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at- first-track operation.   You could also take the CD out while it is "playing".   Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache; maybe you don't even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through UI. Instead; you just wave it at an electronic eye of some sort... and the player recognizes it from the  silkscreening. Kids would like that. "Play this;" they'd say; facing the CD at the player; and the player would start immediately.

Then; some number H; N>H>0; of men has sex with  all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with.    Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of values results in meaningful differences between the sexes'  "promiscuity"; as commonly understood. It should be more  obvious with extreme choices of numbers; but it is also true  for any choice of N and H; if unrealistic totals distract you.   Further; and I was hoping this would be clear without saying so outright; this model actually approximates the cliche  "common wisdom" about per-gender sexual behavior; if you  reverse the male and female roles.   Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple partners -- men being "more promiscuous" than women -- and that  surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of  hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled "sluts").   > So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post; since this > is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.   > There is no disagreement between us; except that I am more interested > in typical behaviour and you in extreme.    Nope; now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to make it more defensible. What I objected to was:   Robert Harley: # >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous # >than males simply does not fit the facts; Hrdy contended.   # Well; DUH!!!   # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly; # precisely identical between males and females.   # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.   If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue; would you have needed to jump in with a patronizing "DUH!!"?    If you were talking about fuzzy; typical behavior; would you have  huffed and puffed with the words "perfectly obvious" and "exactly;  precisely identical"?    If your concern was with the "typical"; why didn't you adopt the  typical definition of "promiscuous"; rather than a straw-man definition which allowed you to interject "DUH!!" and mock an anthrolopology professor's conclusions?    > Actually; you probably just > had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.   You are welcome to that theory!   But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing  and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. "DUH!!... perfectly obvious...  exactly; precisely identical..." -- and that pronouncement is  itself sloppy and erroneous; then others may get a kick out of  popping your balloon.

I'm skeptical.     One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples; frequently to the point where the fiction is more "real" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist; playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies); and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse; even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship; the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture.   I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people; no matter where you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population; which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

And persistently getting in someones face is assault; a criminal offense. If these people have something to say; they can say it with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on... these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of how it affects other people; and that is immoral at best and downright evil at worst.

Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about  life on Earth today.   The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy  that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in  an imperfect world.   >  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations.

I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa;  our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in  practically every market it's entered; nearing 90% listenership in  Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news; well past BBC and  taking share from every other government broadcaster.   It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term  as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.   Many of you may disagree; but I found the document below surprisingly  centrist. If you know the code; you can hear clearly partisan tones; re:  ICC; Taiwan Relations Act; etc. But; still; this is as much a Democratic  platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared  they might.   As you read; replace "United States" with "Roman Empire" and it may make  as much sense; in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be  about that; but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President  might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to  our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations  overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on  how engaged we are in the world around us.   Heck; I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the  globe; a softly glowing necklace of embassies; carriers; arctic research  stations; hotels; golf courses; warehouses; libraries; clinics and all  the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.   Of course; this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the  real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes.  I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit  such a principle to be loosed upon the world.   Rohit

China?  Ooops; no wait; scratch that.   There is one counter example that I can think of; but it may not be precisely "free trade/markets" -- when Ben Franklin first visited England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben explained that they used "Colonial Script"; a kind of barter-dollar; and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years; the colonies were rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.   According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political party here in Canada; the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about tea taxes; it was the banning of colonial script they were protesting. If this is true; then it comes right back to the forces that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes they were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada was also a prosperous nation until; by an act of parliament in the late-50's or early 60's; the right to print money was removed from the juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.   I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse of the Canadian economy fits the profile; but there are oodles of other causes (for example; spending money like we had 300M people when we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?

HAM,        http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top    The New York Times September 23; 2002 High-Altitude Rambos By BOB HERBERT   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar; a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth; Fla.; found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger; Steven Feuer; had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.   Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer; who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat; the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer; hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged; finding him another seat in first class. The incident; already scary; could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.   One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats; and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.   The passengers were petrified; with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.   "I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin;" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas; a veteran of 20 years in the military; who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."   Dr. Rajcoomar's wife; Dorothy; who was seated quite a distance from her husband; said; "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English; and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom; he or she might be shot.   There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later; Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then; shockingly; so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind; handcuffed him and; for no good reason that anyone has been able to give; hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.   This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar; a straight-arrow retired Army major; had done anything wrong.   Dr. Rajcoomar; who is of Indian descent; said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.   Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals; but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration; which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.   The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too closely."   If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S.; a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.   Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "I had never been treated like that in my life;" he said. "I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed."   Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.   "We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security;" said Dr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country; and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."

As it was posted to "discussion" I thought there'd be some.   Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill lamenting the fact that some people know how to fill out a permit so that they can take advantage of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups get specific "zones" and that it's not up to the police to decide what messages and signs get put into what zones to most expediently keep order.     The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied nowadays; that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting political rallies that you don't agree with has become common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled that there are some restrictions on the first amendment. They teach you that your very first year of law school.   I think that given the information as laid out by the story; Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost  every American seems to involve the ability to communicate an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience that has immediate; harmful; and sometimes physical  effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person.

These analogies can be very informative; and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity; but they cannot be used uncritically because they are; in the end; just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must   based on more than analogies; since analogies can be misleading as well as informative.    In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design; but I will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering; The Tower and the Bridge; by David P. Billington. Although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages; we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly.    According to Billington; there are three values common to many technological activities; which we can call ``the three E's'': Efficiency; Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology; which Billington calls the scientific; social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in turn.      Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used   In structural engineering; efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific (strength of materials; disposition of forces; etc.). Similarly; in programming language design; efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming Languages). In the early days; the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time; although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time; and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking).    Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time; but we must be careful that we   not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time; and neither one is the same as programmer time. Similarly; computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator; such as money; but this brings in economic considerations; to which we now turn.      Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost   Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue; economy is a social issue. In structural engineering; economy seeks   maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges   usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design; the ``public'' that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work.    Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example; the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost   computer time compared to programmer time; the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs; and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development.    Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major manufacturers support the language; whether prestigious universities teach it; whether it is approved in some   by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense); whether it has been standardized; whether   comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by novices or dilettantes); and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles; social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language.    Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money; but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also; many social issues; from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures; are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered   seeking an economical design.      Elegance Symbolizes Good Design   ``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer; but Billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering.    For the Designer   It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples). Structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity; but Billington observes that the best designers don't make extensive use of computer models and calculation.    One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not; and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well. Also; equations are often simplified (e.g.; made linear) to make their analysis feasible; and this   another potential source of error. Because of these limitations; engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy).    Similarly in programming language design; the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under-engineered design; in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions; and an over-engineered design; in which we have confidence; but which is inefficient or uneconomical.    Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design. Billington explains that this accident; along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures; was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However; the very problem that destroyed   Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles.    According to Billington; the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do   abandon it altogether). Rather; their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined; that is; there are many possible solutions to a particular problem; such as bridging a particular river. Therefore; expert designers restrict their attention   designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced; and the design looks stable if it is stable.    The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good; and therefore the design process can   guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea   inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that; in structural design; function follows form. He adds   21); ``When the form is well chosen; its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words; the choice of form is open and free; so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and economical design). If we do so; then we can let aesthetics guide design.    The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good; and bad interactions look bad - we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design; without having   check all the possible interactions.    For the User   In this case; what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment; and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it. So also; the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it; because we have (well-justified) confidence in the consequences of our actions.    We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed; and collapses; it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the outside. So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial; that is; if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design; then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their (unwarranted) confidence.    In summary; good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a consequence; these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense; as can the users of the structures (bridges or programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way; but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages:                                  The Elegance Principle                 Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good.        The Programming Language as Work Environment   There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable   safe; like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop?    A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's fatigue and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance; but should serve more as a collaborator; encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a natural extension of the driver; so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant; efficient and economical programs.    Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example; in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess; sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication; down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values; it encourages us to think about them; by neglecting or negating other values; it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention. Out of sight; out of mind.      Acquiring a Sense of Elegance   Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach; so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design; which; especially in Europe; is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers. Because of it; structural engineers design many more bridges than they build; and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public also critiques the competing designs; and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers.    So also; to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively - and criticize; revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs and try to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing'' comes along.

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"" that ' s why i ' m sitting up  here and you are all sitting out there ! ""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ""  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that .  you have just received information that can give you financial  freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a  little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few  months than you have ever imagined .  follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any  way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a  copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of  the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name  will be on everyone of them !  remember though , the more you send out the more potential  customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials  and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to  you now !  "" think about it . "" before you delete this program from your  mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really  think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when  you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no  matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !  you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you  have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody  jacobs , richmond , va  here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $  this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am  sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days .  before you say "" no way ! "" please read this program carefully . this  is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making  opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all  multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new  partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows  you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a  product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are  filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you  do it privately in your own home , store , or office .  this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere :  this is what you must do .  1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell  them if you don ' t have them ) .  * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the  report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name &  return address ( in case of a problem ) .  * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of  any mail problems !

copy  and paste method works well , .  3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names ,  and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction  portion of this letter .  your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely  you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet  connection and e - mail is free !  to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders !

HAM,     "Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa ."

HAM,     "Subject: refined products line - - north american markets - cera alert : decem  ber 15 , 2000  cera alert : december 15 , 2000  title : refined products line - - north american markets  cera knowledge areas : refined products  us margin highlights  * responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,  us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel  to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned  to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at  exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average  $ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel  lower than this year ' s first quarter average .  * high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,  averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel  from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented  values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

HAM,     "Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 ."

( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .  factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for  reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time .  the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not  optimal . hence  ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most  accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different  inputs .  ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way ,  however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let  our it staff know that .  ( 3 ) checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in .  however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc .  in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run  out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis .  your help is appreciated .  regards  naveen"

HAM,     "Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

"" it ' s a prudent strategy , but it ' s got to be done in an  orderly way , "" says ronald  barone , analyst with paine - webber in new york . "" what  they ' re doing here is  what they ' ve been incredibly successful at doing , "" he  adds , noting that enron  posted dollars 1 . 3 bn in earnings before interest and  taxes ( ebit ) from its  wholesale energy and services business in 1999 , up 34 per  cent from the  previous year .  earnings from that division accounted for two - thirds of  the company ' s overall  income before interest and taxes last year , and mr barone  sees the unit ' s ebit  increasing 15 - 30 per cent annually over several years .  as with gas and power and now broadband , where enron is  standardising  contracts and creating a market in bandwidth , it wants to  create markets by  entering as a physical player and providing merchant ,  risk management and  financial services over the internet .  "" we will provide electronic commerce , but we will provide  liquidity and we will  provide settlement , or fulfilment of that contract , "" mr  skilling says . "" that is an  extremely powerful model . if you look at other b 2 b sites ,  they don ' t do that . ""  mr skilling argues enron ' s e - commerce platform will  triumph over the other ,  bulletin board - type exchanges , where striking a deal  depends on two parties  hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing ,  price , credit and  fulfilment .  not everyone shares that view . some energy companies , for  example , would  rather not do business with a competitor . bp amoco  recently purchased a 3  per cent stake in altra energy technologies , a houston -  based , neutral  wholesale energy exchange . with koch industries and  american electric  power , it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the  site to lend it liquidity .  just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals ,  enron believes it  needs networks of strategic physical assets . in acquiring  mg , enron got a  stable of warehouses , lending it a strong physical  position .  "" it should provide ( mg ) with a more vibrant , more active  physical spot market  in more markets in the world , "" says greg whalley , chief  executive officer of  enron net works , the new division enron is launching to  identify and enter  commodity markets . he argues that in metals and other  markets , enron will  deliver better pricing , price risk management services ,  cross - commodity  transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range  of customers .  mr skilling says there are significant rewards for  restructuring an industry .

HAM,     "Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay ."

HAM,     "Subject: re : outage tracker option and background  karl ,  thanks a lot . i have passed this information to grant masson  who worked here on a related problem .  he will get in touch with you regarding this technology .  vince  karl tomlinson @ enron _ development  07 / 24 / 2000 06 : 00 pm  to : vince j kaminski @ ect  cc :  subject : outage tracker option and background  vince ,  to follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage .  the system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points .  i am currently chasing nemmco ( au system operator ) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas .  the idea follows along the lines ( literally ! ) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency , which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators . the drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid . the phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off , however a unit failure may be distinct .  the second option relates to how a unit fails , whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns , then the outage will  cause an rf pulse that should propogate across some of the network .  transformers will attenuate the pulse , however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location . measure the arrival time at several point  on the network , work out the shift and backtrack on the network . part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers . the solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  ( i . e . measuring the three phases at lmhz and then sending the data through a  dsp ) . this solution is more complex , however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station . the timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from gps timing , self locating at the same time !  will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups .  karl ."

HAM,     "Subject: interesting article about enron in japan ' s electricity newspaper  japan ' s electricity newspaper ( "" denki shimbun "" , the equivalent of megawatt  daily ) has been running a series of articles about the new century . several  of these have focused on the power industry in the u . s . a friend of mine ran  across one on enron that was published on april 13 and sent it to me . i  thought you would find it interesting .  the article focuses on ees in particular and about how we try to succeed by  being first to meet our clients ' changing needs . it also describes how we  use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive .  the article also briefly mentions the new office in japan .  the most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is  about enron . given what i have read and heard about how nervous the japanese  are about deregulation of the industry , i really did not expect such praise .  denki shimbun also has a web site at "" www . shimbun . denki . or . jp "" . they have  small summaries of the important articles of the day ( the site , however , is  completely in japanese ) . another interesting site is  "" www . criepi . denken . or . jp "" , the english home site of japan ' s central research  institute of electric power industry ( denryoku chuo kenkyuujou ) . the site  has many links to other english - language sites related to the power industry  in japan .  regards ,  eugenio"

HAM,     "Subject: petrochem desk  i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group .  from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .  nelson"

HAM,     "Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240"

SPAM,        Hello!   As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $735 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 11wQFVQ65DdfzWXqup3JdY7prFazMbXjc   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!

SPAM,        <http://krossewer.tk/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable; or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.    The difference between stumbling blocks and stepping stones is how you use them.    The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.    There is little difference in people; but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.

SPAM,        Yeah. I know you are a pedophile. Actually I know way more about you than you think.   I am a computer scientist (internet security specialist) with affiliation with the Anonymous group.   Few months ago you downloaded an application. That application had a special code implanted purposely. Since the moment you installed it; your device started to act like a Remote Desktop I was able to access anytime.   The program allowed me to access your desktop; your camera(s); your files; passwords and contact lists. I also know where you live and where you work..     I was observing you for quite some time and what I have collected here is overwhelming. I know about your sexual preferences and your interest in young bodies.   I have secured 4 video files clearly showing how you mÉ‘sturbate (captured from your camera) to young teenagers (captured from your internet browser). Glued together is a pretty overwhelming evidence that you are a pedophile.   The timestamps on the video files indicate the exact time you have been mÉ‘sturbating to teenagers: Bruce_untroubled_org_1561674055.mp4 (23.3 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1562940994.mp4 (99.8 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1561527084.mp4 (91.9 MB) Bruce_untroubled_org_1560425551.mp4 (15.8 MB)     I am not here to judge the morality of your sexual preferences; I am here to make money. Because I know you are a wealthy person and that you do care about your reputation; I am willing to gÎ¯ve you a chance to atone and I will leave you alone.   You do know what Bitcoin is; right ?   You must fund a special address with 5;000 Ã™SD in Bitcoin; otherwise; I am going to seÆžd those video files to your family members; friends and your work buddies.   I know it may be time consuming to buy 5;000 Ã™SD in bitcoin; so I will gÎ¯ve you exÉ‘ctly one week. Search on google 'how to buy bitcoin' and seÆžd it to me. Enough is enough. I have seen enough..     If you do not Ð…eÆžd the bitcoins in one week; I will also Ð…eÆžd those video recordings to your local police office. Your life will be ruined; trust me. Æ¬rÉ‘nsfer details are below..

SPAM,        Hi; dear user of lists.untroubled.org   We have installed one RAT software into you device  For this moment your email account is hacked too.   Changed your password? You're doing great! But my software recognizes every such action. I'm updating passwords! I'm always one step ahead....   So... I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence. The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.   I posted EternalBlue Exploit modification on porn site; and then you installed my malicious code (trojan) on your operation system. When you clicked the button Play on porn video; at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device. After installation; your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate; in addition; the software is synchronized with the video you choose.   For the moment; the software has harvrested all your contact information from social networks and email addresses. If you need to erase all of your collected data and video with your enjoy; send me $600(usd) in BTC (crypto currency).   This is my Bitcoin wallet: 15GWKdT8e1o6GcDTZMQZRiZng2Q6dLX8Aw You have 48 hours after reading this letter.   After your transaction I will erase all your data. Otherwise; I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues; friends and relatives!!!   P.S. I'm asking you - not to answer this letter because the sender's address is fake; just to keep me incognito.   And henceforth be more careful! Please visit only secure sites! Bye;Bye...

SPAM,        If you've been diagnosed with type-2-diabetes or pre-diabetes; you're proba= bly up to your eyeballs with diabetes information.   Every doc ; health researcher; and even well-meaning friends have an opinio= n about what causes diabetes and how to treat it.   ...and you know what they say about opinions!   Here are three misconceptions about treating diabetes:           Medications will cure type 2 diabetes           You have to slimming           You can't eat any fat or carbs           You have to get expensive herbal medications   ...frankly: you must suffer the side effects of horrendous drugs; starve yo= urself with impossible diets and exhaust yourself in the gym =E2=80=93 till=  you finally wish you had died before the diabetes was discovered. NO; NO; = NO! There is only one cause for type 2 diabetes. One that nobody pays atten= tion to. Tackling this one cause is so easy that my 85 old mother did it (n= o fault mom). It usually takes less than 28 days to completely reverse type=  2 diabetes using this approach.   And all you have to do is follow the 3 simple steps that I explain in detai= ls here...   http://www.msge9.fun/0s1441e8es13s136s2fes27d3s4c8ds4s1449739   Take Care Jodie Vasser                     if you want to unsubscribe please go here. http://www.msge9.fun/0s1441e8es13s136s2fes27d3s4c8ds1s1449736 or can write to us at: 7098 Snell Ave #451 San Jose; CA 94792

I can not personally manage the fund in my country because of social restrictions on married Muslim women. For this reason; an agreement was reached with a consulting firm to keep the funds with a bank pending when I have a trusted partner to manage the fund. The details will be discussed on your indication of interest with capacity to manage the fund.     My Regards;   Reem Hashimy

SPAM,        Do THIS 1 hour before bed to pee out stubborn fat in the morning:   Recent studies are now showing how a simple tweak to your bedtime ritual can have dramatic effects in shrinking fat tissue while reversing the signs of premature biological aging every time you fall asleep.    In fact; Lisa used this 2-minute daily hack to finally rid herself of 62 lbs of baby weight; which not only resulted in a reversal of Type 2 Diabetes; but also forced her to buy a whole new wardrobe! And her brother John used this same daily ritual to drop 54 lbs of stubborn abdominal fat that had been making him miserable for years; all while sleeping much deeper too. . .    >> Here's how (no plastic surgery needed) http://www.hellfireeven.xyz/bootable-Mankowski/80a4j2395N8L6k10Rd60NJ287Y21bFv4GIf4rxvs4FhIHEsvZ6cdTSmm5R1WI06X@lUHD         Footer http://www.hellfireeven.xyz/9354N2395zS8aT12bOnsd61z287j21zFv4GIf4rxvs4FhIHEsvZ6wdTSmm6vDy1y05GUXHD/dyad-Durward

SPAM,        Attention please!   I am the Chief Financial Officer of Rockhopper and Gas company London UK; and by the virtue; as the Chief Financial Officer. I got your contact through a directory search and decided to propose this business. I am seeking your assistance in remitting of some funds;  Ninety five million  to your account for private investment purpose; hence my request for your assistance.      SOURCE OF THE FUND:   The fund to be transferred into your account is accrued from an over-invoiced contract amount awarded for the completion of the last phase of our refinery; valves and depot for storage of product all over our branches here in the UK which include laying of  distribution pipelines. The contract which was originally valued for One Hundred and Twenty Seven Million was manipulated to read; Two Hundred and Twenty Two Million.  The extra; Ninety Five Million; is what I want to move to your account; the original contractors who executed the job has been paid all their contract bills remaining this Ninety Five Million.    DISBURSEMENT:   I have resolved that you take Forty percent  of the total amount for your assistance. that is; fronting you as a sub contractor to claim the remaining balance of Ninety Five Million  which is left now in our bank from the over invoice contract because it is impossible for me to claim the over invoiced amount without your assistance as a Foreign Contractor. In addition Ten percent has been mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses that   might be incurred by both of us during this business while Fifty percent  will be my own share.   SECURITY:   All modalities to effect the payment and subsequent transfer of this money has been worked out; so this transaction is Hundred percent risk free; though you are required to treat it with strictest confidence; on our acceptance please send to me your personal details and your direct mobile phone number for speedy correspondence.   I am looking forward to doing business with you. Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. Do kindly furnish me with your contact details if you are interested in partnering with me on this transaction.

I am a single Arab woman and serving as a minister; and there is a limit to my personal income and investment level.

The amount is valued at 47;745;533 Euros with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transferral to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund; I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.   If you can handle the fund in a good investment; reply to this email only: reem2018@daum.net   Best Regards; Ms. Reem

SPAM,        Dear sir;;     My name is DR Steven M Duba ; the son of MR. Theo Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South African Information exchange Johannesburg.     Due to the previous war against white farmers in Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country; he ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country;my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt MUGABE. The president’s supporters invaded my father’s farm; burnt everything in the farm; arrested him and confiscated all his investment.   Early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president Mugabe started; my late father envisaged a worse situation; he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa. When he arrived South Africa; he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company; then; went back home. He registered the box as family treasure.   While he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture; he directed me to his lawyer in South Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He was arrested on the 5th of March last year. Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of December 2001.I came to south Africa March;2002.   Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and depressing because my father’s lawyer is presently hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem; though the lodgment documents are with me; as such I want to relocate to your country for good. Presently; my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum permit as a refugee.   I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of this country to your country for investment. If you think you can help me; Please try to get in touch with me immediately with the  number below . Your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my country is still lingering; please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret; because I wouldn’t want anything that will expose me; and the existence of this money.   Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.   Sincerely yours;   STEVEN DUBA (DR).   TEL:27-83-713-2696                     __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

However; the additional  information won't be required.   The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads; as  campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the  same time; opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous  political spam.   Target Wireless; a small New Jersey-based wireless media company; had  asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter; saying that requiring  financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would  use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.   Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from  the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was  supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee; the Cellular  Telecommunications and Internet Association; and some advertising trade  groups.   FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the  commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the  potential to reach more voters.   "We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work;" he said.   Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous.   Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.   Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as  "good for America."   "It will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office;" he said. "We have free speech on our side."

I was puzzled at first; but I think I understand what happened.   First; I approved the post because it didn't appear to be spam; even though it wasn't from a member.

Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.   A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past?   Certainly not Christianity; Islam; etc. B) "How it is currently being expressed" amounts to a tacit  acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and  people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive  expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less  sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke  the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of  society.

D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud; recently more or  less concluded; is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated  by splitting society too much along religious lines.

In 1968; Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the  Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South.

The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.   Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed; it is placed in a "public" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change; and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.       GATHERING THE DATA   While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air; a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30;000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75;000 cubic kilometers of air.   The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their "brightness" - varies according to temperature.   Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.       VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS   A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a "remarkable" level of agreement between the two.   To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units; Christy compared temperature readings recorded by "radiosonde" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.   He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.   "The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement;" Christy said. "If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites; that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."   The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe; the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.   Globally; however; the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.   "These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet;" Christy said. "They are not representative of the total globe."   Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world; usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere; the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.   While there are more than 1;000 radiosonde launch sites globally; the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland; Trinidad; Truk Island and Alaska.   In an earlier study; an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade; which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time; Christy said.       GLOBAL COVERAGE   One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.   The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions; including Antarctica; the Brazilian rain forests; the Sahara Desert and Greenland.   The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5;000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.   Most of these thermometers; which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground; are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries; these thermometers are most often found at airports.   The ground-based network is extensive in North America; Europe; Russia; China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa; South America; Australia and across much of Southern Asia.   Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "Radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world; usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.   While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world; they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1;000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world; that would equal approximately one for every 195;000 square miles of the Earth's surface.   Water temperatures; which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures; come from thermometers on piers and buoys; and aboard "ships of opportunity." The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage; tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes; and in harbors.   In the past 12 years; a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established; gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU   With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years; a method was devised to merge all the data into a single; consistent time series.   Each satellite has its own bias that; if not calculated and removed; would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years; and were sufficient to determine these biases.   Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations; the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)   To check the final product; comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above; and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS   Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities; the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads; parking lots; runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.       INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY   While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature; this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.   The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard; nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.   Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.       THE SCIENTISTS   In 1996; Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored "for developing a global; precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites; fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."   AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards; and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.   In 1991; Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.       DR. JOHN CHRISTY   Christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987; after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno; his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary; and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.   He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign; IL; 1983-87; an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota; 1981-82; and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College; 1980-81.   He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion; S.D.; 1978-82; and as science master at Baptist High School; Nyeri; Kenya; 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.   Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center; and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an "invited key contributor" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change; and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.       DR. ROY SPENCER   Spencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison; WI; in 1981; after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC; 1984-87; before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.   He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.       BIBLIOGRAPHY   (1) J.R. Christy; 1995; "Climatic Change;" Vol. 31; pp. 455-474.   (2) J.R. Christy; R.W. Spencer and R.T.

HAM,        Let's say you're behind a firewall and have a NAT address. Is there any way to telnet to a linux box out there in the world and set your DISPLAY in some way that you can create xterms on your own screen?  
HAM,        Better late than never -- I received a grant from Project Athena; MIT's original courseware effort; and found at the end that they hadn't thought much about distribution of the courseware.  Instead; they had gotten wrapped up with X and various Unix tools; and other useful; but not strictly educational efforts.         > -----Original Message----- > From: B.K.

HAM,     Subject: stephen bennett  norma ,  i fully concur . what can we do about it ? can we change the job classification  retroactively ?  vince  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 12 / 12 / 2000  02 : 41 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from : mike a roberts 12 / 09 / 2000 10 : 33 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an   under hire .  he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive  promotion .   at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as  professional meteorologist .  in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a  new - hire  to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .

HAM,     Subject: re : var  vince  thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own  discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and  administration of var .  we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for  example , are easily made , supported and reviewed .  it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward  paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at  pressure  points  .  i am putting together the scope of a  general overhaul  of the var process ,  including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so  be assured of our co - operation .  dp  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : kaminski , vince  sent : wednesday , april 11 , 2001 2 : 49 pm  to : port , david  cc : lavorato , john ; kaminski , vince ; tamarchenko , tanya  subject : var  david ,  during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the  problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .  we have agreed on the following :  1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will  investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .  2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity  should be  modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense  to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less  transparent aggregates .  3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be  systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions .  this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the  responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .  vince
HAM,     Subject: todd kimberlain  vince / vasant :  do you know who todd kimberlain is ? is he supposed to be in the research  group and charged to our cost center ? he is .  i have never heard of him , but when you pull his name up , it shows that he  is reporting to mark tawny , but is in the research group and being charged  to our cost center .  he is also on our time site , but i have not been doing his time . i hope  somebody  has !  let me know ,  thanks !  shirley
HAM,     Subject: proj . x analytics diligence  paul ,  vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the  trading analytics . there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a  two day time period . i think a reasonable start would be the following :  1 . obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been  implemented in order to verify profitability , and p / l volatility of each .  2 . review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare  these to projections for trading income .  3 . review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a  change of ownership would not have adverse consequences , i . e . are there  guarantees of continued access using the current systems ?  4 . review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets ? it is far from  clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the  current limited  electronic  liquidity .  5 . review , at least qualitatively , the current trading strategies being  used . try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these  strategies will disappear as other ' s implement similar trading models . what  is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage .  6 . review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will  be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and  outdated .  7 . try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading  technology to enron ' s other markets , given the illiquidity of these markets  as compared to the financial equity markets .  if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis , we would  probably want to run their system on a test set of data .  let me know if you have other suggestions .  - - stinson

HAM,     Subject: re :  joe ,  i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston  for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use .  vince  joseph hrgovcic  08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject :  vince ,  i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long  term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than  the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and  that they are an  old boy ' s network  resistant to new developments , but i  don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as  the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented  phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or  so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something  even close to that will not be an easy task .  that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look  into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm  traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,  i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put  together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian  has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several  dozens of  possible  temperature forecasts every morning , which would be  calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i  would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a  far better  best guess  ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a  distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :  1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a  more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that  with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )  2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to  week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )  3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,  e . g . ,  expect the trough to recede  we could sort through the different monte  carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and  use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures  corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of  getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean  temperature - wise  4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such  models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the  traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly  match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;  although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating  month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the  visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .  just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has  written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who  worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a  simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version  of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to  implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the  technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather  consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily  ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .  they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs  on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .  i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not  sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of  enron , and not just the weather desk .  i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the  opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with  christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more  likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian  model ) .  joe

HAM,     Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees  to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order  to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for  at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south  america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to  the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the  transition , jim will join ees .  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale  businesses and the commercial support functions :  enron net works  louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and  ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .  enron americas  concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for  operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,  marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report  into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility  for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south  america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief  operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron  americas .  enron europe  the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia  and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john  sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .  enron global markets  enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and  ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have  responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the  exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to  enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the  commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,  equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .  enron industrial markets  enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,  president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .  commercial support for ews  the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,  the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in  the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more  efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across  ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these  newly defined roles are as follows :  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office  operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice  president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated  services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the  wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these  services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will  continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible  for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .  legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .  regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a  regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in  the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all  european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue  to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions  and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief  of staff .  public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional  basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,  enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue  in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler  will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as  well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .  these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship  to mark palmer , vice president of communications .  business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover  ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .  attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale  services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization  continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .  enron global exploration and production  and enron wind  as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments  around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to  egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff  baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron  wind , will report to cliff .  corporate staff  we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,  government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in  that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and  community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and  chief of staff .  committee structure  in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s  growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our  business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to  be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and  the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be  drawing on this group to lead company -

HAM,     Subject: possible rtp conference  dear mr . kaminski :  thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would  like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .  as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing  power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it  seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the   forgotten resource  in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a  lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many  researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was  asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give  it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by  policymakers .  frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a  useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major  sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron  that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,  it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the  conference is widely circulated among key government groups .  i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and  recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to  participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of  providing funding for this effort .  thank you ,  hill huntington  - retail notes . rtf  hillard g . huntington  emf - an international forum on  energy and environmental markets voice : ( 650 ) 723 - 1050  408 terman center fax : ( 650 ) 725 - 5362  stanford university email : hillh @ stanford . edu  stanford , ca 94305 - 4026  emf website : http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / emf /

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is  pricing substitute products on the internet  , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .

SPAM,        <http://ereston.tk/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Hate. It has caused a lot of problems in this world but has not solved one yet.    The difference between stumbling blocks and stepping stones is how you use them.    We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are.    There is little difference in people; but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.

SPAM,        Hallo;   Ich muss sagen; es tut mir wirklich leid; dass ich davon ausgehe; dass Sie meine Nachricht erhalten und sich dafür entschieden haben; nicht zu antworten; Ich habe eine erste E-Mail an Sie gesendet; in der Hoffnung; dass Sie bereit sind; durch Nominierung Empfänger / Eigentümer zu werden; und zwar auf 12;196 Mio. EUR. Ich muss dringend einen Verwandten / Begünstigten vorlegen; um Empfänger des oben genannten Fonds zu werden. Der Klient starb ohne schriftliches VERFÜGEN oder KODIZILL. Da wir keinen identifizierbaren Erben dieses Nachlasses haben; tun wir nichts Ungewöhnliches. Es ist eine Win-Win-Situation für Sie; da es kaum eine Chance gibt; dass Sie in irgendeiner Weise mit dem Kunden verbunden sind; aber selbst wenn Sie es nicht sind; haben wir mit den gesicherten Mitteln am Ende eine weitaus bessere Chance; den Empfänger oder Verwandten zu finden des verstorbenen Kunden. Normalerweise werden alle nicht beanspruchten Gelder nach einer Wartezeit dem Staat übergeben oder von den Bankdirektoren als Bonusüberschuss aufgeteilt. Dies sind Mittel; die für ein gewisses Maß an guter Arbeit eingesetzt werden können. Ich beabsichtige; damit fortzufahren. weil ich das größere Wohl und die Möglichkeit sehe; die Wünsche eines Menschen wirklich zu erfüllen. Dies ist eine Gelegenheit für mich und ich habe mich dafür entschieden; daran zu arbeiten. Aber ich muss wissen; ob ich mit Ihnen daran arbeite. Sollte dies nicht möglich sein; löschen Sie die E-Mail und beenden Sie die gesamte Kommunikation. Jedoch; Wenn Sie etwas erreichen möchten; indem Sie sicherstellen; dass die Gelder nicht in die Taschen einiger überbezahlter Ärzte und Direktoren gelangen; können Sie die folgenden Details bestätigen.   * Vollständiger Name und Postanschrift. * Telefon- und Faxnummer. * Nationalität / Beruf.   Hinweis: Aus Sicherheitsgründen werde ich Ihnen die vollständigen Details mitteilen; sobald ich auf Sie zählen kann. Ich freue mich darauf; von Ihnen zu lesen.

SPAM,        Hello!   As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your device.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $888 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1C1ehibCgeuLwF4VbSAzoDapDLbKtjivbP   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best regards!

SPAM,        Dear user of untroubled.org!       I am a spyware software developer.     Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2019.       The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through whic= h you went online (Cisco router; vulnerability CVE-2019-12643).       I went around the security system in the router; installed an exploit t= here.     When you went online; my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit)=  to your device.     This is driver software; I constantly updated it; so your antivirus is = silent all time.       Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via = the VNC protocol).     That is; I can see absolutely everything that you do; view and download=  your files and any data to yourself.     I also have access to the camera on your device; and I periodically tak= e photos and videos with you.       At the moment; I have harvested a solid dirt... on you...     I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the=  entire history of the sites you visit.       I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update pa= sswords from your accounts every times.       I know what you like hard funs (adult sites).     Oh; yes .. I'm know your secret life; which you are hiding from everyon=       Oh my God; what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh; you dirty naughty p= erson ... :)       I took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult conten= t; and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera.     Believe it turned out very high quality!       So; to the business!     I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all=  your contacts.       Transfer $650 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1NKrw3sP7C9igNozkB2P= d4VnZuk8d6WGV     Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.     If you do not know how to do this - ask Google.       My system automatically recognizes the translation.     As soon as the specified amount is received; all your data will be dest= royed from my server; and the rootkit will be automatically removed from yo= ur system.     Do not worry; I really will delete everything; since I am 'working' wit= h many people who have fallen into your position.     You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in=  the router so that other hackers will not use it.       Since opening this letter you have 48 hours.     If funds not will be received; after the specified time has elapsed; th= e disk of your device will be formatted;     and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your co= ntacts with compromising material.       P.S. Do not try to contact me (this is impossible; sender's address was=  randomly generated).       I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on=  my server).       Good luck!

SPAM,        To put the final driving force behind this project; I   have also  realized a zÃ©n (chan philosophy) name   of the divine; in the project  "I/T Eon  Enligthenment".   As all information is factorized right in I/T Sys;   with compatibility  back to Adams tablet; suiting   chan philosophy ("zÃ©n"); Islam and  scientific  monotheism; many will  ofcourse want the  standard paradigm;  and this is  what this project  is about.   No unnatural restrictions of three-letter  paradigms; but natural  resources in the right  place; such as monotheism is. And ultimately  scientific monotheism; and observation of all  things; is realizing one  creator; and  enligthenment.   So my research on history and philosophy is   concluded in four projects  now:   I/T Sys - a fair pay interface system for the whole   of internet;  compatible with all information back   to Adams tablet; the original  source of what   became fair pay principles; and definer of Shaytan  (or  psychopath; the enemy of your wording of   choice). Reading also society  for technocracy;  which means groupings; which take information  further  to leader; as a filter of relevance; and  product quality.   I/T Eon Enligthenment - Here I realize a chan  philosophy ("zÃ©n") - name  of the divine; answering  the current cultural  dynamic; fusing chan  philosophy; Varanger faith; Islam and scientific  monotheism as one  stronger monotheism;  respecting all developed schools.   I/T Partiet - Norwegian for The I/T Party; a  suggestion for a political  party; where the   democracy is perfected in I/T.   I/T Trance Star - about the original rave culture; an  example of a  culture that really was a push for the  same. Suggesting fair pay  integration of tracker  files; which I always found to be a superior  format.   Still today; the earliest files; can be played back in  24bit  96khz uncompressed; with modern  (4- band) mastering; level tweakable if  wanted. With   Polyphase Resampling; without interpolation  errors.   All linked here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRjdZU88Jtu3_HL_N0_KkiA   Peace.

SPAM,        Dear friend;   I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire; now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter.    This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan; Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled; while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However; due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries.    Hence; my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government; and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18;000;000;00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf; so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds.

SPAM,                              Welcome to "Ghetto" America! …...Yes; you heard me; I said "Ghetto" America! What is "Ghetto"  America; I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned;  this explanation may not sit well with many of you; however it is  no less true! "Ghetto" America is a society of individuals  comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the  impoverished; and often unpolished side of "Black America;"  Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a  typical ghetto community; namely the "projects" and noticed an  unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular  neighborhood; and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have  been to a shopping mall; and noticed an unusual amount of young  "teen looking" black women carrying infants; or pushing baby  carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also  noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying  them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the  absence of the all important "wedding band" missing from their  respective ring fingers!" .And of course we have all heard  stories of young black men carrying guns; and knives; allegedly  mugging; robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know  that many young African American women refuse to date African  American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In  fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who  represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as  "Thugs" or "Street Hustlers;" Also; did you know that many young  African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while  living in government housing better known as the "projects"  rather than move away; purchase new homes; save; or even make  investments?       "Attention" This is Not another "Boyz in the Hood" Story!   These newly distinguished "Black Generation Xers" are suffering  through utter chaos. "Baby Makers; Loser choosers; Welfare  Abusers...Images of My America" is a collection of observations;  and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African  American Male who experienced; and perpetuated many of the truths  that many in "Black America;" and the world in general would have  you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds  light on the oppressive; and often discriminatory nature of  "Mainstream American Society." A society that has nurtured the  rampant disregards for self-respect; and enlightenment that many  young African American men; and women currently suffer from. The  writer supports his arguments with direct references to the  overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to  raise children; with many being teens themselves; and the foolish  criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes  being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or  cool neighborhood reputation.   The author also identifies the self-destructive and often  criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily  basis like; refusing to pursue higher education; carrying guns;  robbing; stealing; selling drugs; driving fancy cars; and wearing  expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior  committed by both males; and females is due in large part to a  lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless  homes. These poor choices; and behavioral disorders coupled with  the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in  the form of welfare abuse; and over crowded prison populations  are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty; and lack  of direction that currently exists in young "Black America"  today.

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail; success in this business is now fast; easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering!   I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not; who is President; or whether you keep your current job or not.

What the heck." Believe me; no matter where you believe those "feelings" come from; I thank every day that I had that feeling.    I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!   Before you say "Bull"; please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet; a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below; to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.   Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".   DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED; IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.   This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment; I received a total $610;470.00 in 21 weeks; with money still coming in."   Pam Hedland; Fort Lee; New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: "This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290;000.00. So far; in the past 8 months by re-entering the program; I have made over $710;000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."

INSTRUCTIONS:   =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====   For each report; send $5 CASH; THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.   ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER; MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.   Within a few days you will receive; via e-mail; each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1;000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.   IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report; or their sequence on the list; in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works; you will also see how it will not work if you change it.    Remember; this method has been tested; and if you alter it; it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way.

Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.   1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports; take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5.

Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.   4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.   5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2   6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.   PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.   ================================================== **** Take this entire letter; with the modified list of names; and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.   Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet; the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally; where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:   METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================   Let's say that you decide to start small; just to see how it goes; and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5;000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5;000 each.   Continuing with this example; you send out only 5;000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response; that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 50;000. Out of those 50;000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.   Those 100 people mail out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 500;000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.   Those 1000 people send 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10;000 orders for Report # 4.   Those 10;000 people send out 5;000 e-mails each for a total of 50;000;000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100;000 orders for Report # 5.   THAT'S 100;000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500;000.00 (half a million dollars).   Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5;000 + 4..... $50;000 + 5.... $500;000 .... Grand Total=$555;550.00   NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT; YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================   REMEMBER FRIEND; THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5;000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100;000 e-mails each or more?   There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting; with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me; many people will do just that; and more!   METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================   Advertising on the net is very; very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive; all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.   This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out; with your name and address on it; will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.   ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved; etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.   ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper; write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering; YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !   =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== "My name is Mitchell. My wife; Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing; spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her; and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.    Well; the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147;200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."   Mitchell Wolf M.D.; Chicago; Illinois ================================================ "Not being the gambling type; it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am; I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319;210.00 in the first 12 weeks.    The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."   Dan Sondstrom; Alberta; Canada ================================================= "I had received this program before. I deleted it; but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course; I had no idea who to contact to get another copy; so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490;000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."   Susan De Suza; New York; N.Y. ================================================= "It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20; in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362;840.00. Life is beautiful; Thanx to internet."

HAM,        The Scotsman - 22 August 2002    Playboy wants to go out with a bang       AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into  his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250;000  (£160;000).     Rolf Eden; 72; a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners;  said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive  young woman - preferably under 30.     "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with  me gets all the money;" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper.     "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of  fun with a beautiful woman; then wild sex; a final orgasm - and it will all  end with a heart attack and then I’m gone."     Mr Eden; who is selling his nightclub this year; said applications should be  sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon;" he said.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers — while others are c= onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a= ncient religions; mathematics and even music.

HAM,        Evening Standard - 28 August 2002   [Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA]    'Lost' penguins found alive    by Charles Miranda    A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in  Antarctica has been found alive in a "big huddle".     The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New  Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica  had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island.     Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made  it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in  October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: "The  penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a  successful breeding season over the winter."     Some 1;000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall  and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier; 50 miles from the US McMurdo research  station. The 200;000-strong Adelie penguin colony; which also nests at the  cape; may have lost up to third of its population.

HAM,        (Via Robot Wisdom)   Maybe you UC folk know these people?   http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/lcc-sph082202.php   Working at Lewis & Clark College; the University of California at Berkeley;  the University of California at Santa Barbara; and Stanford University;  the interdisciplinary team:       * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability  depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces;       * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water  molecules; and   * discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry; not surface  chemistry. In other words; the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot  hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.   To verify its experimental and theoretical results; the gecko group then  used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two  different materials.   "Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted;" notes Autumn; assistant  professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland; Ore. "Our  initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically  inspired dry; adhesive microstructures; which can have widespread  applications."

No dumping tea in the  harbour or anything like that. I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on  television; and that the tactics can be justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative  viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand; it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault; and  the protestors were not in anybody's face (at least in my understanding of the vernacular).   And no; being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence  politicians; but the standard way of using lobbyists and writing checks is beyond many of us.   Owen                
HAM,        http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0;;SB10327475102363433;00.html     The Wall Street Journal   September 23; 2002 COMMENTARY   Rebuild at Ground Zero   By LARRY SILVERSTEIN   Earlier this month; we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11; 2001. All of those who perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and; indeed; for all of us.   But for the good of the city and the region; the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site.   About 50;000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost; along with those of another 50;000 people who worked in the vicinity. Together; those jobs in lower Manhattan; for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus; produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion; or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region; but many have not. New York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs; the deficit may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.   If we do not replace the lost space; lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them; and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue; the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said; "This is New York; a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life." That is why they were destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced; and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.   In recent weeks; redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site; however; but on all of lower Manhattan. Further; many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere; scattered in several sites; or simply never rebuilt.   These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed; and what must be recovered; was the Trade Center; not all of lower Manhattan. Except over the towers' footprints; where there must be no commercial development; the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.   Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations; plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned; such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct "Train-to-the-Plane" Long Island Rail Road connection; the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development.   And New York will need the space. Before 9/11; the Group of 35; a task force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin; concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300;000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need.   As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market; I would simply point out that history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998; this space had been absorbed; at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.   We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about 10 years; with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet; much lower than the 1990s' rate.   Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view; nor will most New Yorkers.   Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city "has to do two things: memorialize; but also build for the future." I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate -- and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural significance; a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened; and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area.   The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.   Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties; a real estate firm whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.    
HAM,        OK; let's bring some data into the discussion: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm (A graph; derived from Vostok ice core samples; of CO2 and temperature fluctuations over the past 400k years).   > Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and > temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest > correlation between the two. In a number of cases; CO2 level increases > are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the > increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature > preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done > of the geological record; the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are > correlated with temperature increases; but are not significantly > causative.   Based on the Vostok data; you are right; there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations; but it doesn't always appear to be causal.   > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations; it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100;000 years.   Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.   > As it > happens; current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.   Not correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and <http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm; 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore; CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years; much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution).   > In other words; we may be adding to the CO2 levels;   No; we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870; the "historical record").   Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record; it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*; not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase; except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.   > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record.  At the very least; there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations.   Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years; unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike; and then return back to "normal" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores).   Still; by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2; a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away.   > Also; CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature.  Again; the interaction is not entirely > predictable; but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative > feedback systems mentioned above.   Yes; clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still; we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2; and if the world temperature doesn't increase; but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time; the effects would be enormous.   > Last; as greenhouse gases go; CO2 isn't particularly potent; although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and > methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule > basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas; something > that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the > biosphere.   Correct.   Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm   Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting; and rice paddies outgassing); and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well.   Data on water vapor here: http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html   > CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism; but all the recent > studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a > passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.   I tend to think that holistic; and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar; wind and nuclear; with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground; for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a "sustainable" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But; as California showed during last year's energy crisis; shifts in patterns of consumption are possible; and improved efficiency is an easy sell.

HAM,        The structure of the Internet has never been about where the ditches and ruts are dug although the world needs ditch diggers too.   It's a simple inductive concept: You are you and see the world as such; You plus 1 degree of separation is a new you.   All this stuff about scale-free Internets; viruses; sex; and money is silly.  Scale-free statistically indistinguishable models really means Internet-Scale as rediscovered by social networks people.   > Research has shown that the network of human sexual partners   > seems to be scale-free; too   I tend to prefer the Harvard Business Review to the Economist as they tend to spend less time writing about who's sleeping with whom and come up with real statistical models.

HAM,     "Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben"

"" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use ."

HAM,     "Subject: el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven ' t already seen this :  el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 )  houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg )  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . "" we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s  involvement in california , "" said norma dunn , senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . "" we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . "" the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a  "" conspiracy "" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately  dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities  for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 ,  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california "" energy crisis ""  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily  regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped  in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and  increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers ,  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of  peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable  at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term  power market . "" california is currently in a difficult position , but now  has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term  energy policy , "" said dunn . "" el paso has been one of the largest suppliers  of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively  participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term ,  stable solution to california ' s energy needs . "" el paso corporation , the  largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world , spans the  energy value chain from wellhead to electron . with an enterprise value in  excess of $ 50 billion , el paso is a leader in every phase of the natural  gas industry . the company owns and operates a significant portion of the  north american natural gas delivery grid , operates the fastest growing ,  most sophisticated energy merchant group , and is the nation ' s third largest  natural gas producer . el paso , a leader in risk management techniques , is  focused on maximizing shareholder value , transforming existing markets , and  speeding the development of new markets . visit el paso at www . epenergy . com .  cautionary statement regarding forward - looking statements this release  includes forward - looking statements and projections , made in reliance on  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act  of 1995 . the company has made every reasonable effort to ensure that the  information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are  based are current , reasonable , and complete . however , a variety of factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections ,  anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release . while  the company makes these statements and projections in good faith , neither  the company nor its management can guarantee that the anticipated future  results will be achieved . reference should be made to the company ' s ( and  its affiliates ' ) securities and exchange commission filings for additional  important factors that may affect actual results .  bob brooks  gpcm natural gas market forecasting system  http : / / gpcm . rbac . com"
HAM,     "Subject: california power update 1 / 17 / 01 pt . iii  1 . california ag exploring investigation of power profits  sources report that the california attorney general ' s office , in a meeting  yesterday , ordered a review of the federal profiteering statute . in keeping  with the recent  rhetoric by gov . davis , this action is almost certainly directed toward  investigations of profits made by generators and marketers .  2 . more detail on bankruptcy - creditors concerned about lengthy "" cure period ""  the generators want to limit their exposure as general creditors in a chapter  11 proceeding . their ability to their exposure depends on the "" cure period ""  for  making good on a defaulted payment , which would be dictated by the specific  contract terms . if the "" cure period "" - that is , the time the utilities have  available to  make up for missed payments before the generators or the power exchange can  take them to court - is a short period of time , for the sake of argument 30  days , then the utilities ' creditors have to swallow another 30 days of  accumulated ( impaired ) receivables before they can move to the more  desirable position of postpetition suppliers ( in which bills do get paid , as  would be directed by the bankruptcy court judge ) . if , however , the utilities  have a longer "" cure period "" , for the sake of argument 60 days , then their  creditors will effectively have to swallow 60 days of accumulated impaired  receivables on which they will ultimately have to take a substantial haircut ."

"" the 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent  rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .  crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment  banker .  he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were  included in our december 1999 and may 2000  surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in december . it  also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .  the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p  expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent  earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,  227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent  versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  december . higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""  crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :  apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .  ( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .  ( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and  development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :  sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and  titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned  u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett  resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington  resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .  ( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :  hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner  energy corp . and williams production co .  the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8  percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .  among the 14 companies in this category , 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates  during the first six months , including amerada hess  corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum  corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .  ( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal  dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .  ( nyse : tx ) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates , while the  remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey  remained the same .  ' the increase in canada . . . is nothing short of staggering . . . '  "" the increase in canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is  nothing short of staggering , "" crandell continued . of  the 85 companies that he contacted , 44 . 7 percent budgeted higher  expenditures for 2000 than for 1999 . "" compared with  december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc . ( nyse : tlm ) led the group  with a huge increase , followed by anderson  exploration ltd . ( tse : axl ) , gulf canada resources ltd . ( nyse : gou ) , murphy  oil corp . ( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian  petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .  counterparts , producers above the border raised  their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow , according to the lehman analyst .  he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well  above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them . ""  overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned .  he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets , including  texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf  s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and  amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized  companies .  crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during  2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25  per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what  lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30  per mcf of gas ) . "" this suggests a stronger second  half than expected , should companies raise budgets further to reflect the  higher prices , "" he said .  - nick snow in washington  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by john peyton / hou / ect on 06 / 19 / 2000 07 : 36  pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com on 06 / 19 / 2000 08 : 27 : 26 pm  please respond to nobody @ maill . djnr . com  to : 1346 @ wctopics . djnr . com  cc :  subject : energy : oil drilling : survey finds producers plan to spend more than  originally planned in . . .  survey finds producers plan to spend more than originally planned in  2000  oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning  of the  year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year update of its annual e & p  survey .

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris"

SPAM,          Most of us refuse to believe that another 9/11 event could possibly happen again in the USâ€¦   Especially since we know that the US successfully toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan and killed the Al Qaeda founderâ€¦     Yet THIS undisclosed video reveals a threat that could wipe out 90% of US population in the next couple of months.     In fact; itâ€™s the startling reason why NORAD started moving critical assets back inside Cheyenne Mountain and decided to spend over $700 million to harden the mountain even further.     Watch this leaked video before it disappears again.   water freedom     PS: More than 375;983 patriots have already watched this truly disturbing video.   >> Watch The Video While Itâ€™s Still Available                                 "3569 Cardinal Lane Indianola; IL 61850" Unsubscribe

SPAM,            My Dear in the lord     My name is Mrs. Mina A. Brunel I am a Norway Citizen who is living in Burki= na Faso; I am married to Mr. Brunel Patrice; a politician who owns a small = gold company in Burkina Faso; He died of Leprosy and Radesyge; in the year = February 2010; During his lifetime he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Mi= llion Euro) Eight million; Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagado= ugou the capital city of Burkina Faso in West Africa. The money was from th= e sale of his company and death benefits payment and entitlements of my dec= eased husband by his company.   I am sending you this message with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow = in my heart; and also praying that it will reach you in good health because=  I am not in good health; I sleep every night without knowing if I may be a= live to see the next day. I am suffering from long time cancer and presentl= y I am partially suffering from Leprosy; which has become difficult for me = to move around. I was married to my late husband for more than 6 years with= out having a child and my doctor confided that I have less chance to live; = having to know when the cup of death will come; I decided to contact you to=  claim the fund since I don't have any relation I grew up from an orphanage=  home.   I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless b= abies/Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God be= cause I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have de= cided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for = the good work of Almighty God; I will be going in for an operation surgery = soon.   Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity pu= rposes. Because of this money remains unclaimed after my death; the bank ex= ecutives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe = use it for selfishness and worthless ventures; I need a very honest person = who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; wido= ws and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be name= d after my late husband and my name.   I need your urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this proje= ct; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferre= d to your bank account or online banking.   Thanks Mrs. Mina A. Brunel

Every person who did this 60-second trick before going to bed; experienced a dramatic rejuvenation of their gums; rebuilt their teeth. . .    And even got rid of bad breath and ugly spots. . .

SPAM,        May the peace of God be with you ;   I am glad to know you; but God knows you better and he knows why he has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be surprised at all. My name is Mrs.Lila Lucas; a widow; i have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease. At this moment i am about to end the race like this because the illness has gotten to a very bad stage; without any family members and no child. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to entrust to you for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband;the sum of ($11.000.000 Eleven million dollars.) deposited in the Bank. Having known my present health status; I decided to entrust this fund to you believing that you will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein.Therefore I need you to assist me and reclaim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages and giving justice and help to the poor; needy and to promote the words of God and the effort that the house of God will be maintained says The Lord." Jeremiah 22:15-16.=E2=80=9C   It will be my great pleasure to compensate you with 35 % percent of the total money for your personal use; 5 % percent for any expenses that may occur during the international transfer process while 60% of the money will go to the charity project. All I require from you is sincerity and the ability to complete God's task without any failure. It will be my pleasure to see that the bank has finally released and transferred the fund into your bank account therein your country even before I die here in the hospital; because of my present health status everything needs to be processed rapidly as soon as possible. Please kindly respond quickly. Thanks and God bless you;   May God Bless you for your kind help. Yours sincerely sister Mrs. Lila Lucas.

Just for the record mc has a nice directory comparison function.

HAM,     Subject: ebs ' s approach to storage trading  hi ravi - -  thanks for you note . i would be very interested in a meeting to establish an  ebs - wide approach to storage . it ' s a huge opportunity .  we could expand the 2 : 30 pm friday meeting to include all interested ebs  people and discuss the topics below . could shalesh coordinate this meeting  and also coordinate the ongoing effort firm - wide ? have i omitted anything  below ?  as i see it , here are the key storage initiatives that ebs should undertake ,  and who is involved up to this point .  1 . - establish storage contract terms and pricing  who ' s involved : virawan , jean mrha beach  a . define terms for storage needed for ebs products ( mediacast ,  mediatransport , and new products )  b . define general terms for other storage contracts  2 . - establish storage pooling points ( spp )  who ' s involved : shalesh , richard reichardt , mark palmer , kara knop  who ' s needed : other designated people from bloomer and griebling groups , jim  crowder ' s group input on alliances  a . define technology needed  servers , storage devices  control software for physical delivery  b . decide optimal spp locations  at / near existing bandwidth trading pooling points  at / near existing ebs city pops  at a hosting partner location  c . engage optimal partners to create spp  ibm  ibm global services  tivioli ( storage management software )  emc  sun  compaq  existing storage portal vendors ( e . g . storage networks )  3 . - establish storage trading benchmark  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : research group  a . define unit of measure for trading contract ( e . g . , terabyte - month )  b . establish pricing mechanisms  4 . - identify ( and monetize ) storage market opportunites  who ' s involved : unknown  who ' s needed : cox ' s group , bloomer ' s group  a . storage intermediation opportunities  b . establish virtual storage portal service for ebs  ravi thuraisingham  03 / 08 / 00 11 : 00 am  to : mark s palmer / enron communications @ enron communications , jean mrha / enron  communications @ enron communications , john bloomer / enron communications @ enron  communications , richard reichardt / enron communications @ enron communications  cc : kara knop , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince kaminski , david cox / enron  communications @ enron communications , shalesh . ganjoo @ enron . com  subject : meeting for friday on storage  hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you . i  would like to discuss with you and possibly with john bloomer and richard  reichardt about the ebs research ' s role in supporting the storage market  development from the origination and trading perspective . there are several  people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what ' s my  take on our involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise .  shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort  with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and  standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly  supervising him in this effort .  shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at  one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded  storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh  to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is  our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting  jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with  request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s  role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to  coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market  assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties  involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based  on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to  suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking ,  understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data  gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the  need and as you request them .  please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner .  kind regards ,  ravi .  a bit about ebs research group  john bloomer and richard reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and  stinston gibner ' s role in ebs . i lead a team of quantitative professionals  via a group we are calling ebs research . this group reports to stinson  gibner ( vp ) and vince kaminski ( md and head of enron research ) . stinson and  vince are the original founders of enron corp research that has been charged  with model development efforts to support enron energy trading and other  enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses  ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting  and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) .  within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard  ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) ,  and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and  john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a  key role with john griebling ' s go forward network design and implementation  through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and  modeling effort .  -

SPAM,        Hello!   As you may have noticed; I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account.   I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.   If you are not familiar with this; I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen; turn on the camera and microphone; but you do not know about it.   I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.   Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver; I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.   I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen; and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse; I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.   If you want to prevent this; transfer the amount of $510 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this; write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").   My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1DrCbXWfTqJbaiak2wjGUQiEo1WBzCBnof   After receiving the payment; I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 48 hours to pay. I have a notice reading this letter; and the timer will work when you see this letter.   Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.   If I find that you have shared this message with someone else; the video will be immediately distributed.   Best wishes!

SPAM,         Greetings My Dear;     I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (eleven million dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also  build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is  maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death; so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen

SPAM,        Background: Apparently a FreeBSD developer; a viking looking fellow;   has been hiding a secret: just as many of his predecessors in the Danish  cities during WWII (collaborators); He has a disdain for "the jews"  collectively.   (No great surprise: he is a european; and past actions speak louder than  any present words.)   Thus he blaims them collectively for the modern military slaughter of  innocents we see from all modern militaries (Usually it's the USA  however)   Apparently there was a debate; you can see it here:  https://twitter.com/bsdphk/status/1126199508449341440   He also seems to lament the Danish uprisings against the nazis of the  past (which he sees as not the finest thing).   So he's clearly a white who hates the jews. He probably has no problem with white women ruling over him; ofcourse:  that's "the way it should be".   Then someone decided to attempt to "CoC" him (report him and get him  thrown out of FreeBSD).   No man should be thrown out of a code project for their beliefs  regarding endless slaughter. Slaughter is the "work" of men: and it is  right for them to have an opinion regarding it - it is only natural. The  blacksmith has an opinion on the qualities of various sourced iron; the  thresher: his grain; and the man: in what ways and quantities blood  should be shed.   (Women should be thrown out of code projects before they utter a word;  naturally; for banning men from marrying young girls; ofcourse (YHWH  allows men to marry young girls: Devarim chapter 22 verse 28 (na'ar  (hebrew masoretic text: child)) (padia (greek septuagint: child))  (puella (latin vulgate: young girl)))   So; in furtherance of the principal that men; who are murderous by  blood; should be free to discuss their ancestral occupation:  Poul-Henning Kamp has been sent this message regarding license  revocation and gratis non-exclusive license:  https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/9/434   "No slaughter" is a ... valid ... view. At least for a time. It is his  right to hold it; Though not a realistic view

Please take your time to read this message; although we have never met before; this is no spam; It's a real message sent to you. I know also that you will be amazed at the level of trust that I am willing to place in a person that I have never seen nor spoken with. If I can receive favor from someone I barely know; its not bad entrusting this project to unknown person as long as my spirit directed me to you.   I have been a catholic priest for over 22 years. I spent about 10 years serving at Africa; Burkina Faso to be precise; I spend most time in Ouagadougou Cathedral. Presently; I had a heart surgery on the 23-11-2018 and the Doctors have informed me that I cannot live longer; I had a serious bleeding after the operation. Before I left Ouagadougou to my country for the surgery; a priest friend of mine visited me from Netherlands with three companion; when they went back; one among his companion Transferred 10M$ in my personal account with Bank of Africa and advised that I use the money to help the poor; handicaps and less privileges because he saw the level hardship then.   Because of my present health condition; I cannot live to proceed with the projects; therefore; I have decided to appoint you to reclaim the money which total sum of $10;970;000.00 (Ten million Nine Hundred and seventy Thousand US DOLLARS).   I want you to use this sum to make the world a better place for the poor and less privileged; help the needy and also help your family members.   I took this decision because I was raised in an Orphanage so I don't have relatives and presently; I'm still in the hospital; where I am undergoing treatment. That's why I have decided to contact you so that you can contact my account manager in Bank of Africa; reclaim the money and make good use of it.   then you can contact me through private email addres(RevWrightWatson@yandex.com)   Regards; Rev.Wright Watson

SPAM,            Good day;   You were recommended by a mutual associate. I write you regarding an investment of bearer bonds I made on behalf of a client.           The investment was made in 2009 and has been under my management. The said investor is deceased. The window is now available to assign these bonds to any name or company of my choice. I have all the necessary information to achieve this within 10 banking days.               The total value of the bond is 100million pounds sterling; in a million pound denominations.                If you can handle this; do contact me at your earliest convenience via my email robertdankworth@aol.com So we can discuss the final details Thank you.   Mr ROBERT DANKWORTH

SPAM,        Greetings;   I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before; but need not to worry as I am contacting you independently of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11;300;000.00 USD immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.   I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased customer (the account owner) who died along with his supposed NEXT OF KIN since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 15 years; because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury account as an unclaimed fund.   By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.   Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.   Best Regards; Mr. Afrin Gawa

An account was opened in my bank by one of my customers in the name of MR. THOMAS BAHIA a Dutch National from Germany who made a fixed deposit of $11;500;000.00 (Eleven Million; Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and never show up again and I later discovered that he died with his entire family members on a plane crash that occurred in Libya on the 12th of May 2010 and below is a link for your view.. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/world/middleeast/13libya.html Now I want to present a foreigner as next of kin to late Thomas so we can make the claim and you can contact me if you are interested so I can give you more detailed information about this transaction. For the sharing of the money will be shared in the ratio of 50% for me; 40% for you and 10% to cover our expenses after the deal. Now the total amount to be transferred is $12.2 million because of the interest the fund has accumulated since 2010. Please keep this absolutely confidential weather interested or not. Thanks.Dr. Grayson CarsonPvt: drgrysonc@gmail.com

This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry; the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor; remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$52.750 million; which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.   As government officials; we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts; and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$52;750;000.00 million)15% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account  while 85% will be reserved for us.

SPAM,               Looking for Property in Spain?   Don_t waste your Time!  That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?    Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!    You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!    How Frustrating!!!    The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.   What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

HAM,        I vote usb 1.1 as the chances are the cdr drive is not over 8x write and thus fireware is of no real use... but i cant see how you are going to get it working without a cradle. I cant even get my dell laptop dvd drive to work as the connectors are not the same as my cd drive ones.. seems dell cant keep any standards going :-(    
HAM,        Hi All;   Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side; but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.   The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to ~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.   Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps; but HyperTerm in Windows worked first time(!?); any ideas?   Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity   I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:   AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1   ... which is most of the defaults.   USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42))  & set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)   But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving     btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their modems may be difficult.

HAM,        Hi Kragen;      This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example; I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while); I think that the most important issue; which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems; is almost passed over.  I know that you know this; and you allude to it; but your essay is getting passed around; so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.      There's one other point which you don't make; which I think is very important; which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped; uninvited; about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples; in the open; that you can define a set; and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions.      I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure; we wouldn't have Stackguard; ITS4; Nissus; or snort.  And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.

Briefly; "iDEFENSE"; which bills | itself as "a global security intelligence company"; is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known; especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else.   | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue; it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.   | At the moment; the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as "full disclosure"; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them; and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information; including code to exploit the | vulnerability; if possible.     | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | CERT in the late 1980s; which its proponents might call "responsible | disclosure" --- never release working exploit code; and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features; and often; even after the patches were released; people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was.   | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible | disclosure" process kept their victims; who had no connections in the | underground; vulnerable.   | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous; because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software; | turning off vulnerable features; filtering traffic in transit; and | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders.  Also; software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems; and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible.   | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information; rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.     | Not long before; Snosoft; a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements; apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically; they apparently made a private offer to | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if | HP retained Snosoft's "consulting services".  HP considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats; and Snosoft published the | information.   | If this is allowed to happen; it will cause two problems which; | together; add up to a catastrophe.   | First; secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder; and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later; | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates; although that will not be obvious to the sellers.   | Second; finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be | --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years; while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.   | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software; but I don't think that's | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them; the software vendor is never held liable; often; in fact; the | people who administer the software aren't liable; either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site; for example. | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time; and it might save the software vendor some | negative PR; but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.   | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably; that | means organized crime syndicates; although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist.   | There might be the occasional case where a market leader; such as | Microsoft; could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in | Samba; for example.   | Right now; people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject; motivated by the public | interest; motivated by a desire for individual recognition; or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies; terrorists; and organized crime.   | Let's not let that happen.         | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:   | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] | Sent: Wednesday; August 07; 2002 12:32 PM | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program     | Greetings;   | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities; exploit code and malicious code.   | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program:   | Q. How will it work? | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation; rather; it could be for any of a number | of motivations; including the following:   |          * Pure love of security research |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure   | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the | Internet community; but who would also like to be paid for doing the | work.The compensation will depend; among other things; on the following | items:   |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided |          * The potential severity level for the information shared |          * The types of applications; operating systems; and other |            software and hardware potentially affected |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs |          * The level of exclusivity; if any; for data granted to iDEFENSE   | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? | A. The VCP is open to any individual; security research group or other | entity.   | Q. Why are you launching this program? | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More | often; many of these services charge clients for access without paying the | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program; the contributor is | compensated; iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue; and iDEFENSE clients and the | public at large are warned in a timely manner.   | Q. Who gets the credit? | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or | exploit information.   | Q. When can I contribute? | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.   | To learn more; go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP; please | contact us at contributor@idefense.com.   | Regards;   | Sunil James | Technical Analyst | iDEFENSE   | "iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively | monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and | hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. | The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers; frontline | security professionals and network administrators with timely access to | actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. | iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities; examines | the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new | software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."   | http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork       "It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once." 					               -Hume     http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

So for a message I will insert a  signature; but for another message I will insert a different signature.   Is it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.   Thanks.

HAM,          "60 Minutes II" Bush Interview:   (CBS) No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of  life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison; nearly  200 years ago; has seen the nation’s capital city successfully attacked.  But; one year ago; President George W. Bush was thrown into the first  great crisis of the 21st century.   This is the president’s story of September 11th and the week America  went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush; one; on Air  Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year;  the president is still moved; sometimes to the point of tears; when he  remembers Sept. 11.   “I knew; the farther we get away from Sept.11; the more likely it is for  some around the world to forget the mission; but not me;” Mr. Bush says  during the Air Force One interview. “Not me. I made the pledge to myself  and to people that I’m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So  long as I’m president; we will pursue the killers and bring them to  justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.”   The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One; where Pelley  joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II  wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first  hours after the attack.   Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane  been so central to America in a crisis.   For President Bush; Sept. 11 2001; started with the usual routine.  Before dawn; the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before  6 a.m. and; at the same moment; another man was on the move: Mohammad  Atta. Two hours later; as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school;  hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the  airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m.; jet  engines echoed in Manhattan.   Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.   “I thought it was an accident;” says Mr. Bush. “I thought it was a pilot  error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a  terrible mistake.”   Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a  class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when; just  after nine; United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was  the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was  a coordinated attack.   Back in the Florida classroom; press secretary Ari Fleischer got the  news on his pager. The president’s chief-of-staff; Andy Card stepped in.   “A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack;” Card  told the president   When he said those words; what did he see in the President’s face?   “I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said;” Card recalls. “I  think he understood that he was going to have to take command as  commander-in-chief; not just as president.”   What was going through Bush’s mind when he heard the news?   “We’re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we’re going to do  something about it;” Mr. Bush recalls. “I realized I was in a unique  setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us; and I was  looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I  can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to  get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident  that we were; you know; that the world had changed.”   Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called  the vice president; pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the  attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first  words to the nation.   "Ladies and gentlemen; this is a difficult moment for America;” he said  in the speech. “Today; we’ve had a national tragedy.”   It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke; Mr. Bush didn’t know that two more  hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick  Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent  ran in.   “He said to me; ‘Sir; we have to leave immediately’ and grabbed; put a  hand on my belt; another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the  door of my office;” Cheney recalls. “I’m not sure how they do it; but  they sort of levitate you down the hallway; you move very fast.”   “There wasn’t a lot of time for chitchat; you know; with the vice  president;” says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford; who was in his  command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First  Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. “We knew there  were unidentified planes tracking in our direction;” he says.   Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the  Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war; and this  was it. On her way down; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice  called Mr. Bush.   “It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get  out of the West Wing;” says Rice. “They were hurrying me off the phone  with the president and I just said; he said; ‘I’m coming back’ and we  said ‘Mr. President that may not be wise.’ I remember stopping briefly  to call my family; my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say; ‘I’m fine. You  have to tell everybody that I’m fine’ but then settling into trying to  deal with the enormity of that moment; and in the first few hours; I  think the thing that was on everybody’s mind was how many more planes  are coming.”   The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever; the Secret  Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of  succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become  president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President  Cheney; fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says  when he heard the other officials were safe; he decided to stay at the  White House; no matter what.   “It’s important to emphasize it's not personal; you don’t think of it in  personal terms; you’ve got a professional job to do;” says Cheney.   Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers  hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the  capital.   Says Mineta: “Someone came in and said ‘Mr. Vice president there’s a  plane 50 miles out;’ then he came in and said ‘Its now 10 miles out; we  don’t know where it is exactly; but it’s coming in low and fast.’”   It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m.; it exploded into the Pentagon;  the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.   As the Pentagon burned; Mr. Bush’s limousine sped toward Air Force One  in Florida. At that moment; United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane -  was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House; the staff was in  the West Wing cafeteria; watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer  Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.   “I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled  ‘Women drop your heels and run; drop your heels and run;’ and suddenly  the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and  the whole White House just flooded out;” she recalls.   In Florida; as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One; he was overheard telling  a Secret Service agent “Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters  protected.” At 9:57 a.m.; Air Force One thundered down the runway;  blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications  Director Dan Bartlett was on board.   “It was like a rocket;” he remembers. “For a good ten minutes; the plane  was going almost straight up.”   At the same moment; 56 minutes after it was hit; World Trade Center  Tower Two began to falter; then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche  of steel; concrete and human lives.   “Someone said to me; ‘Look at that’ I remember that; ‘Look at that’ and  I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and  the horror of that moment;” recalls Rice of the TV newscast.   She also felt something in her gut: “That we’ve lost a lot of Americans  and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of  course I felt the anger.”   Down in the bunker; Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked  planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.   As the planes track toward Washington; a discussion begins about whether  to shoot them down. “I discussed it with the president;” Cheney  recalls. “‘Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these  airliners that have been hijacked?’ He said yes.”   “It was my advice. It was his decision;” says Cheney.   “That’s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot  down your own civilian aircraft;” says Bush. “But it was an easy  decision to make given the – given the fact that we had learned that a  commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision; it  was; I didn’t hesitate; let me put it that way. I knew what had to be  done.”   The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They  fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow.  The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.   “Clearly; the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of  government as they could: the Pentagon; perhaps the Capitol; perhaps the  White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us  psychologically and symbolically in a very important way; too;” says  Rice.   Meanwhile; Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43  minutes. At 10:29 a.m.; it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of  its twin.   The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure  location somewhere in Washington. “I was horrified;” she says. “I  thought; ‘Dear God; protect as many citizens as you can.’ It was a  nightmare.”   By 10:30 a.m.; America’s largest city was devastated; its military  headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf  Coast.   “I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the  consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining  moment in the history of the United States;” says President Bush. “I  didn’t need any legal briefs; I didn’t need any consultations; I knew we  were at war.”   Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the  horrifying pictures; but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to  Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting;  “This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.”   “I was trying to clear the fog of war; and there is a fog of war; says  the president. "Information was just flying from all directions.”   Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David  had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush’s ranch.   “I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit; or  that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of  different information;” says Card.   They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the  president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code  name for Air Force One; Mr. Bush told an aide; “Angel is next.” The  threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.   “It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get  the president home;” Tillman says. “We actually have to consider  everything we say; everything we do could be intercepted; and we have to  make sure that no one knows what our position is.”   Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret  Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The  crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from  air traffic control – a suspect airliner was dead ahead.   “Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an  airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with;” Tillman  remembers.   Tillman took evasive action; pulling his plane high above normal  traffic. They were on course for Washington; but by now no one thought  that was a good idea; except the president.   “I wanted to come back to Washington; but the circumstances were such  that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national  security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back;” says  Bush.   So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in  Nebraska. Back in Washington; the president’s closest advisor; Karen  Hughes; heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr.  Bush.   “And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that; to me;  sounded very shaken said; ‘Ma’am; I’m sorry; we can’t reach Air Force  One.’” Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the  attacks. When she came back; it was a place she didn’t recognize.   “There were either military; or maybe Secret Service; dressed all in  black; holding machine guns as; as we drove up. And I never expected to  see something like that in; in our nation's capital;” says Hughes.   When she walked into the White House; no one was inside. “I knew it was  a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody; and so I yelled;  ‘Hello?’ and two; again; kind of SWAT team members came running; running  through the; the hall with; again; guns drawn; and then took me to; to  the location where I met the vice president.”   On Air Force One; Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most  visible plane in the world; a 747 longer than the White House itself. He  didn’t want to use his radio; because the hijackers could be listening  to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the  telephone.   “We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were  heading;” says Tillman. “We; we basically just talked to 'em and said;  'OK; fine; we have no clearance at this time; we are just going to fly  across the United States.'”   Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another; warning  each other to keep the route secret.   “OK; where’s he going?” one tower radioed to another.   “Just watch him;” a second tower responded. “Don’t question him where’s  he's going. Just work him and watch him; there’s no flight plan in and  we’re not going to put anything in. Ok; sir?”   Air Force One ordered a fighter escort; and air traffic control radioed  back: “Air Force One; got two F-16s at about your 10 o’clock position.”   “The staff; and the president and us; were filed out along the outside  hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows;”  says Bartlett. “And the president gives them a signal of salute; and the  pilot kind of tips his wing; and fades off and backs into formation.”   The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts; from the  Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander  wouldn’t tell them where they were going.   “He just said; 'You’ll know when you see it;' and that was my first  clue; I didn’t have any idea what we were going up until that point;”  says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.   “We; we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble; bubble around Air Force  One; and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles;” says  Roberts.   Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this  aircraft; or for his own safety: “I looked out the airplane and saw two  F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to  get us.”   We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war;  a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered;  with the president out of sight; was he still running the government? He  hadn’t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly  worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying; “The American  people want to know where their dang president is.” The staff considered  an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force  One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At  11:45 a.m.; they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.   “The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake;  we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless;” Bush  said to the nation from Barksdale.   At Barksdale; the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington  was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska; to the command  center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications  gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One; Mr. Bush had  a job for press secretary Fleischer.   “The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that  was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed;” says  Fleischer   Fleischer’s notes capture Mr. Bush’s language; plain and unguarded. To  the vice president he said: “We’re at war; Dick; we’re going to find out  who did this and kick their ass.” Another time; Mr. Bush said; “We’re  not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.”   The President adds; “I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense; I  said; ‘We’re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary; you  and Dick Myers;’ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs; ‘are  going to go get them.’”   By 3 p.m.; Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in  Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that  gave no hint of what they would find below.   At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground  Command Center. It was built to transmit a president’s order to go to  nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in; the battle staff was watching  the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed.  After a short briefing; Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference  center which connected them to the White House; the Pentagon; the FBI  and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.   According to Rice; Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls  that Tenent answered: “Sir; I believe its al Qaeda. We’re doing the  assessment but it looks like; it feels like; it smells like al Qaeda.”   The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an  essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.   A flight attendant on American Flight 11; Amy Sweeney; had the presence  of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the  seat numbers of the hijackers. “That was the first piece of hard  evidence. We could then go to the manifest; find out who was sitting in  those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those  individuals; as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and  going through a process of elimination;” says Mueller.   In Nebraska; the White House staff was preparing for an address to the  nation from the Air Force bunker; but by then the president had had  enough. He decided to come back.   “At one point; he said he didn’t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him  out of Washington;” Fleischer says. “That verbatim.”   On board; he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world:  “I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that  you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist; because I knew these terrorists  like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The  other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition  of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.”   As Air Force One sped east; the last casualty of the attack on America  collapsed; one of the nation’s worst days wore into evening. At the  World Trade Center; 2;801 were killed; at the Pentagon; 184; and in  Pennsylvania 40. Altogether; there were 3;025 dead.   “Anybody who would attack America the way they did; anybody who would  take innocent life the way they did; anybody who's so devious; is evil;”  Bush said recently.   Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in  Washington; he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the  way to the White House.   Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White  House to return to? “I don’t remember thinking about whether or not the  White House would have been obliterated;" he recalls. "I think I might  have thought they took their best shot; and now it was time for us to  take our best shot.”   Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks.  His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff  were already working on the speech.   “He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was  reassurance;” remembers Hughes. “We had to show resolve; we had to  reassure people; we had to let them know that we would be OK.”   Just off the Oval Office; Mr. Bush added the words that would become  known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those  who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr.  Bush didn’t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and  he was emphatic about that.   He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first  heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty  million Americans were watching.   “Today our fellow citizens; our way of life; our very freedom came under  attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts;” he said  from the Oval Office that night.   The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American  history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House  residence for the night; Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White  House daily log: “The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today.  We think it's Osama bin Laden.”   (CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned; President Bush was demanding a war plan. No  one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the  president would do. In office for just eight months; he’d never been  tested as commander-in-chief.   “I never asked them what they thought;” President Bush said of the  Pentagon brass; “because I didn’t really – because I knew what I was  gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done; Scott. And that was to set  a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it; hunt them down and  bring them to justice.”   In the cabinet room; the president made clear what was next: “The  deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against  our country were more than acts of terror; they were acts of war;” he  said.   To the war cabinet; al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor  Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to  strike bin Laden’s organization well before Sept. 11.   “The president said; ‘You know I’m tired of swatting at flies; I need a  strategy to eliminate these guys;’” Rice recalls.   In one of the worst intelligence failures ever; the CIA and FBI didn’t  pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without  a sense of urgency; the White House strategy the president had asked for  came too late.   Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for  was “literally headed to the president’s desk; I think; on the eleventh;  tenth or eleventh; of September.”   On Sept. 12; the war cabinet was debating the full range of options -  who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who  worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate  cruise missile strike; of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in  the past.   “Well; there’s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon; anyway;” Mr.  Bush tells Pelley. “A lot of people like to chatter; you know; more than  they should. But no; I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense  (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what  we called ‘boots on the ground.’ That if you’re gonna go to war; then  you’ve gotta go to war with all your assets.”   The president says he wanted to “fight and win a guerilla war with  conventional means.”   It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director  George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and  intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the  Taliban government.   Secretary of State Colin Powell; noting that the CIA had already  developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance; called it an  unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.   “As I like to describe it to my friends;” Powell says; “we had on the  ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some  CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force; the  best in the world. How do you connect it all?”   The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.   Meanwhile; Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day  before; he had called the Pentagon the “mightiest building in the  world.” Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American  Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush  left; he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering  the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch. The next day; Sept. 13; there was another warning of attack that the  public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but  this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House.  The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.   “He wasn’t real receptive to that; to that recommendation;” remembers  Brian Stafford; director of the Secret Service. “And he ordered a  hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening  and that’s what he did.”   The next day; would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the  president. On Friday; Sept. 14; Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet  meeting; but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.   “He sat down; slightly overcome; for a moment but he recaptured it;”  says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have  trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service  later that morning.   “And I just scribbled a little note to him;” Powell recalls; “and I  said; ‘Mr. President; I’ve learned over the years when you are going to  give a very emotional speech; watch out for certain words that will  cause you to start to tear up.’ He looked at me and he smiled and then  at the next break in the conversation he said; ‘The Secretary of State  told me not to break down at the memorial service;’ and that broke the  tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.”   First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and  she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. “I wanted  the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting; because I think  we were a country; that needed; everyone of us; needed comforting.”   It also stirred the mourners’ resolve; as Rice remember. “As we stood to  sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic;” she says; “you could feel the  entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen; the kind  of spine; and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.   “We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had  been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what  had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually  going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.”   Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for  what he encountered there.   “You couldn’t brief me; you couldn’t brief anybody on ground zero until  you saw it;" Mr. Bush says. “It was like – it was ghostly. Like you’re  having a bad dream and you’re walking through the dream.”   The president found the scene very powerful; particularly when the men  and women at ground zero began to chant; “USA! USA!.”   “There was a lot of bloodlust;” the president recalls. “People were; you  know; pointing their big old hands at me saying; ‘Don’t you ever forget  this; Mr. President. Don’t let us down.’ The scene was very powerful.  Very powerful.”   When Mr. Bush tried to speak; the crowd kept shouting; “We can’t hear  you.”   The president responded; “I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of  the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down  will hear all of us soon.”   Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he’d posed with  the firemen who always stood by whenever the president’s helicopter  landed there. Now; five of the men who stood with the president in the  picture were dead – lost at ground zero.   When the president arrived Sept. 14; Manhattan was papered with the  faces of the lost. Families; unable to believe that so many had vanished  in an instant; held onto the hope that their loved ones were just  missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.   At a meeting the public never saw; the president spoke with several  hundred of these families in a convention hall.   “People said to me; ‘He’ll come out. Don’t worry; Mr. president; we’ll  see him soon. I know my loved one; he will - he’ll find a place to  survive underneath the rubble and we’ll get him out.’ I; on the other  hand had been briefed about the realities; and my job was to hug and  cry; but I remember the whole time thinking; ‘This is incredibly sad  because the loved ones won’t come out.’”   One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his  firefighter uniform and as he signed it; Mr. Bush remembers; he told the  boy; “Your daddy won’t believe that I was here; so you show him that  autograph.”   It was an effort “to provide a little hope;” the president recalls. “I  still get emotional thinking about it because we’re dealing with people  who loved their dads or loved their mom; or loved their…wives who loved  their husbands. It was a tough time; you know; it was a tough time for  all of us because we were a very emotional; and I was emotional at  times. I felt; I felt the same now as I did then; which is sad. And I  still feel sad for those who grieve for their families; but through my  tears; I see opportunity.”   The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes;  he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard.  The body of her son; George; was among the first to be found at ground  zero.   “I called the police department;” Howard remembers; “ and they said he  hadn’t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said;  ‘No; I don’t need to call back.’ If he hadn’t called in; I knew where he  was.”   George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993  when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day;  and he was off duty on Sept. 11; but couldn’t stay away. The police  department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.   “He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me;” Howard recalls. “And  he extends his sympathy to me and that’s when I asked him I’d like to  present George’s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who  were killed over there.”   By the end of that day; Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.   “He was physically exhausted; he was mentally exhausted; he was  emotionally exhausted; he was spiritually exhausted;” recalls Card..   The next day – Saturday; Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war  cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.   “My message is for everybody who wears the uniform – get ready. The  United States will do what it takes;” Mr. Bush told them.   As Powell remembers it; “He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was  listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he  wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.”   President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. “On the  other hand;” he says; “I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the  room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.”   When he left that meeting on Saturday night; he still had not told the  cabinet what he was planning.   “I wanted to just think it through;” Mr. Bush remembers. “Any time you  commit troops to harm’s way; a president must make sure that he fully  understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just  spend some time on it alone. And did.”   What were his reservations?   Mr. Bush says; “Could we win? I didn’t want to be putting our troops in  there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.”   Nine days after the attacks on America; before a joint session of  Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.   “Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it  happened;” Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. “We’ll remember  the moment the news came; where we were and what we were doing. Some  will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry  memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It  is the police shield of a man named George Howard; who died at the World  Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom;  Arlene; as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that  ended and a task that does not end.”   A year has passed since then; but the president says his job is still to  remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being  waged; a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office;  literally keeping score; one terrorist at a time.   In his desk; the president says; “I have a classified document that  might have some pictures on there; just to keep reminding me about who’s  out there; where they might be”   And as the terrorists are captures or killed? “I might make a little  check there; yeah;” Mr. Bush admits.   But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list –  Osama bin Laden.   (CBS) A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago; the  president was new on the job; with little experience in foreign policy.  He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now;  on his orders; U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did  not expect; in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week;  CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq;  about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.

HAM,     "Subject: re : progress  steve ,  thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no  bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated  credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the  code .  regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points .  1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work  and she does not have the  necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help .  it ' s  not that the work is beneath her .  2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston .  he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects ""  and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just  tanya ' s issue ,  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful .  3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on  tanya and  me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively  disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the  demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya  to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code .  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and  winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens .  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and  the system cannot fail .  vince  from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : progress  vince ,  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular  distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc . . . .  both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous  occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ?  the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current  system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main  development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved  and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had  a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something  they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i  believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability .  on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei  is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working  with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to  find a common valuation piece between the systems .  i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days ?  also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e .  seperating research domain problems from it problems .  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would  measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that  studying documentation wasn ' t enough .  about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon .  ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and  winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document ,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place .  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do  all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to  do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is  claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and  doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an it issue and ask for help from research .  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely .  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their  progress on friday .  in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution .  regards  steve"

HAM,     "Subject: energy finance critiques  david ,  here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested :  from jennifer martinez ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of  1998 ) :  the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good , especially considering  it was the first year of the program . there were a lot of guest speakers  from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about  the energy industry through case studies , lectures , etc . basically , we  learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance  classes , but all the cases and examples were energy - related . the professors  were good for the most part but didn ' t have a great deal of practical  industry experience . if i had to guess the reason for decreased  participation in the program , i would probably say it is the professors .  ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and  quantitative . some students prefer less technical professors and classes  that aren ' t limiting to the energy industry . also , the fact that the class  meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing . other than those  things , i can ' t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment . i  especially don ' t understand why every single person didn ' t drop for enron . i  wonder if it has something to do with international status . ? ? ?  from john massey ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  bottom line -  ut business schools is great - investment fund - best activity available to  students  energy finance program - fairly weak -  it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a  weak finance appendage -  the finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher , ignorant about  industry specific analysis , devoid of industry experience , rude to outside  lectures ( from industry )  keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small  portion of the class time -  way to make better :  get teachers with practical industry experience -  make it a seminar class - focus on case studies , lectures - given by people  from industry -  promote the class within the business school - i felt like ut did a poor job  of internally ( to students ) promoting the class -  - - - - - - - - - - -  from ross mesquita ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  to be honest , a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific .  when energy applications were presented , it seemed more like general finance  questions were reworded to include energy lingo . we had some very good  speakers , but for the most part , i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had  enough energy focus . i assumed that this would get better as the program  progressed .  one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy  finance is a very specific focus . i would have probably not enrolled in the  energy finance program had it been available in my first year . i did not  know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b - school to  consider several career options - - i . e . , investment banking , corporate  finance , entrepreneurship , marketing , etc . as a new mba student , i would not  want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies .  here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas - -  my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa .  - - - - - - - - - -  from billy braddock ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of  1998 . the primary positives to the class revolved around outside  panels / instruction . for example , enron sent representatives on 2 separate  occasions to discuss particular topics ( vince kaminski and gary hickerson ) .  other notable speakers were jeff sandefer ( independent business consultant  and e & p professional ) , the beacon group , and encap investments . another good  speaker was a professor from ut ' s school of engineering . he brought a good  perspective as to the "" basics "" of the energy business .  the class was structured via a team - based instruction approach , with 3  professors team - teaching a 6 - hour credit course . none of the 3 professors  had any product knowledge of the energy business . of the 3 professors , 2  were research focussed / tenured with little credibility in "" teaching . "" one of  the professors primary focus of research was fixed income , while the other 2  were investments and corporate finance , respectively .  as is the case for ut ' s finance program in general , and energy finance in  particular , ut is in dire need of teaching professors ( as opposed to research  professors ) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples  and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a  finance background . particular to the energy program , ut needs to have more  instruction from energy professionals ( such as the instructors used for  enron ' s internal learning programs ( ie . derivatives classes , etc . ) .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from bryan williams ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998 , at  the university of texas .  the curriculum was understandably  & rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the  first year the energy finance course was offered . however , the instruction  also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak  of ( the 6 - credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors ) .  two of the three professors have co - authored textbooks , and the third  professor  , s claim to fame is fixed income . as a group , the three professors  are research - heavy ( as opposed to industry focused ) , and the team - teaching  format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for  the success of the class .  that said , the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside  speakers . among them : vince  kaminski & gary hickerson , both of enron . they also dedicated one class  period to a video conference call with the beacon group , an energy consulting  group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman .  jeff sandefer , an independent businessman , an entreprenuership instructor ,  and one of the foremost experts in the e  - there are some experienced , brand - name professors ( e . g . sheridan titman )  teaching in the program ;  cons :  - the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies  such as enron . specifically , it might need to help students link to the  interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron ;  from george huan ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken fall of 1999 ) :  companies expect mba students to have both general management ( new ideas ) and  analytic ( quantative ) skills . energy industry is no exception .  energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses  which fit in the insudtry need . however , these two courses are far from  enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation  and excitements and opportunities in this industry . other management and  quantitive courses are needed to complete this program .  my suggestions :  1 ) seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies . before  students make their decisions , let them know : what ' s happening and what ' s  going to happen in this industry ; what the companies are doing now ; who  they are looking for .  2 ) management and / or analytical courses should be included . such as :  strategy , financial enginering and real option .  3 ) more industry connections . presentations and discussions .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from charlie weldon ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken in fall of 1999 )  my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive  experience . the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers  brought in during dr . titman ' s portion of the class . this part of the course  is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~ 10 case  classes all focusing on the energy industry . two of the cases were based on  enron , and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and  well thought out . value added by the professor was less than from the  speakers and cases .  the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options . nearly all  of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy  industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student ' s  understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market . the use  of options and futures for speculating and / or hedging was stressed on  numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power  plant project .  i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to  continuously make improvements to the program . however , i do not believe  that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to  improvement . there is a strong need for more practical based training on  energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron .  the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical , due in large part  to their background . while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding  the basics , the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective  bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course .  until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive  industry experience , i believe the energy finance program will continue to  underdeliver on its objectives . additionally , i believe that the course  structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive  hours of classroom instruction ."

 hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !"

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu"

Email:desmondbikkoh@workmail.co.za Dear Sir/Madam; Guten Tag; mein Name ist Mr. Desmond Bikkoh ; Chef Editor der First  Naional Bank of South Africa (FNB). Ich war ein sehr enger Freund von  Thomas Frie; StaatsbÃ¼rger ihres Landes. HerrFrie arbeitete mit einer  Mienennentwicklungsfirma in Zimbabwe zusammen. Am 21 Mai 2005  verunglÃ¼ckte Herr Frie mit seiner Familie bei einem Autounfall. Sie  befanden sich auf den Weg von Zimbabwe nach SÃ¼d Afrika um den Befehl von  PrÃ¤sident Robert Mugabe  die HÃ¤user der Mitglieder der Oppositions  Partei zu zerstÃ¶ren (Operation Murambatsvina) zu entkommen. Alle  Insassen des Autos starben bei dem Unfall. Seit dem habe ich zahlreiche  Erkundigungen bei Ihrer Botschaft hier in SÃ¼d Afrika angestellt um  Verwandte von Herr Frie ausfindig zu machen. Leider war ich bisher  erfolglos. Nach zahlreichen ergebnisslosen Versuchen Herr Frie's  Verwandten  ausfindig zu machen; habe ich mich entschieden Ihren Namen /Addresse  Ã¼bers German dasoertliche site ausfindig zu machen; da sie die gleiche  NationalitÃ¤t haben.  Ich habe Sie kontaktiert um Ihnen dabei zu  assistieren  Anspruch auf einen  Betrag von 10 Millionen US Dollar;  hinterlassen von meinem Freund Thomas Frie zu erheben; bevor es von der  First National Bank of South Africa konfeziert wird . Die First National  Bank of South Afrika hat mich benachrichtigt das ich einen Verwandten  ausfindig machen muss oder das Geld wird innerhalb der nÃ¤chsten 21  Arbeitstagen konfesziert. In meiner Position als Chef Editor der First  National Bank of South Afrika ist es mir MÃ¶glich das Geld auf ein  gÃ¼ltiges auslÃ¤ndisches Konto zu Ã¼berweien  mit der Sicherung das das  Geld komplett sein wird bis ich in Ihr Land komme um das Geld mit Ihnen   zu teilen. Da es mir  seit  zwei Jahren nicht gelungen ist Verwandschaft von Herr  Frie ausfindig zu machen;  versuche ich Ihr EinverstÃ¤ndnis zu bekommen  Sie als nÃ¤chste Verwandten des Verstorbenen zu prÃ¤sentieren da Sie die  gleiche NationalitÃ¤t haben und somit das Geld zu Ihnen Ã¼berwiesen werden  kann. Wenn Sie an meinen Vorschlag interessiert sind; kÃ¶nnen wir die  TeilungsverhÃ¤ltnisse und UberweisungsmodalitÃ¤ten besprechen.

SPAM,          If you're like most folksâ€¦ you diet; you count calories; you tear up the treadmill; andâ€¦   Nothingâ€¦   Thatâ€™s how one overweight mother with prediabetes was feelingâ€¦   She did â€œeverything rightâ€ and never lost an inch. Untilâ€¦   She stumbled on this strange â€œcarb trickâ€ and burned away an unheard of 22lbs pounds in just 13 daysâ€¦   And because of this one simple shift in her eating; she did it without starving herselfâ€¦!   â€¦ and without a lick of exercise!   Now get this... with the same carb trick she dropped a total of 37lbs in the FIRST month!   â€¦ and shocked her doctor by completely reversing ANY pre diabetic symptoms!   You wonâ€™t even believe her final result so I wonâ€™t bother telling you. However you can see it for yourself on this page...   This might work for men; however itâ€™s only been proven for women...   The odd carb trick burns up to 1LB per DAY                   If you wish to stop receiving our emails or change your subscription options Please Manage Your Subscription 852 Ashcraft Court La Mesa; CA 91941

HAM,     Subject: my model for spikes  dear dr . kaminski ,  i was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis  the first of the preprints that i recently authored on my model for spikes in  power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power . in this  regard , i have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the  center for energy finance education and research and the institute for  computational finance at the ut austin . right now i am also in the process of  forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be  interested in receiving this preprint . please let me know if you might be  interested in receiving this preprint .  i look forward to hearing from you .  sincerely yours ,  valery kholodnyi  manager of quantitative analysis  research and analytics group  txu energy trading  ps . here are the main preprints that i have recently authored on my model for  spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power :  1 . valery a . kholodnyi , the stochastic process for power prices with spikes  and  valuation of european contingent claims on power , preprint , txu - rag - 01 / 00 ,  july  2000 .  2 . valery a . khlolodnyi , valuation of a swing option on power with spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 05 / 00 , august , 2000 .  3 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a spark spread option on power with  spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 21 / 00 , november 2000 .  4 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of european contingent claims on power at  two  distinct points on the grid with spikes in both power prices , preprint  txu - rag - 24 / 00 , november 2000 .  5 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a transmission option on power with  spikes ,  preprint txu - rag - 25 / 00 , november 2000 .  as i have indicated to you in my previous e - mail , contrary to the standard  approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a  stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of  spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian  process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is  markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit  valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that  the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the  absence of spikes .

HAM,     Subject: re : natural gas storage item  vince -  something very interesting about natural gas storage ( from the class ) .  the industry is rapidly adopting what are called  operational balancing  agreements ,  where the pipeline contracts with the producers and ldc ' s  ( public utilities ) to handle all  imbalances  in shipping , namely all  production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise . shippers then  always  book  what is scheduled to happen , and not what actually happens .  the end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions  are used to smooth out not only weekday - weekend seasonal patterns ( the  well - known  parking  ) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well .  cutting to the chase , storage facilities in producing regions are operated to  insure the integrity of the pipeline system , and estimated marketed  production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline ' s  receipt meter than is production less local storage .  clayton

SPAM,        <http://y.smarthaip.ru/?sywp>     Life has many ways of testing a person's will; either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.    The will to win; the desire to succeed; the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.    You yourself; as much as anybody in the entire universe; deserve your love and affection.    When I do good; I feel good. When I do bad; I feel bad. That's my religion.      Best Regards      
SPAM,        <http://kyei.expotavrida.com/?osazu>     I've had a lot of worries in my life; most of which never happened.    There is little difference in people; but that little difference makes a big difference. The little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative.    Life is a gift; and it offers us the privilege; opportunity; and responsibility to give something back by becoming more.    If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing; you're right.      Best Regards

The difference in winning and losing is most often...not quitting.      Best Regards

SPAM,        Good day;     I am Carlos Fuleze; a serving civil servant from Malabo; Equatorial Guinea;=  currently on a six week official visit to Haiti. I am contacting you becau= se I am seeking for a real business professional with whom I can be involve= d in partnership overseas; who also have the ability to manage an investmen= t portfolio in your country preferably in Real estate or Housing Developmen= t. The proposed investment profile will be large in volume and scale; but b= ecause of the restrictive employment regulations in my country; I cannot do=  this while under state employment.     My primary preference is for someone from your country; hence this proposal=  to you. I like to know if you are disposed to that kind of engagement; so = that we may open further conversation along that line and explore what is p= ossible. The civil service and employment regulations in my country prohibi= t me from getting involved in private overseas business; while under govern= ment or corporate employment; hence this proposal to you.  =   If you indicate interest; I can send you my ID; so you can have a better kn= owledge of who you are dealing with. =       I look forward to your response if this appeals to you.     Yours Sincerely;     Carlos Fuleze  
SPAM,        Dear Krauth; I plead an indulgence if I have invaded your privacy by receiving this mail from me without prior permission. With due respect ;I contact you purposely based on the similarities of names between you and my deceased client who was an oil servicing contractor with shell petroleum in West Africa.   This is about Nine years I have been searching the contacts of the relatives to my late client in order that they may come forward for the repatriation of the estate of my late client Engineer Roman Krauth valued $26.4 Million but unfortunately all my search proved abortive and the Togo bank holding these funds issued me a last notice to bring the supposed heir/relatives before the end of April 2019  or they will have the account declared not serviceable thereby confiscating the funds hence my contact to you so that you may stand as the heir and receive the funds into your bank account since you are bearing same surname with my deceased client. I have the death certificate to send to you as well as deposit document as proof. The sharing ratio of the funds after a successful transfer to your bank account shall be 40/60 of which I do have trust that the funds will be secured pending my arrival to meet you in your country.   Waiting to hear from you.   Sincerely yours; Barrister Tamale David

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc"

SPAM,         I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs.Monika John Carlsen; wife of late Mr John Carlsen; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (elevenmilliondollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also  build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God bless you and your family. Regards; Mrs. Monika John Carlsen  
HAM,        Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds* (1851); Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them; he observes; "like a mushroom; seems to have sprung up in the night; or; like a frog in Cheapside; to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard; unknown; uninvented; the next it pervaded London."   Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phrase itself; or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?   And to what event or events does it refer?   I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch Phrases.*

HAM,     Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .

SPAM,        Greetings My Dear;       I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Francisca  Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of (eleven million dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death; so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God Bless you; Mrs. Francisca Carlsen

If you have  serious interest to work with the group directly or recommend a  company to take a private loan or investment funds from the  investors and lenders; me and you will be entitled to 5% of any  amount received by the company from the investors/or lenders; but  if you are taking the fund directly as a company; I will be  entitled to 2.5% as a commission fee. There will be a face to  face meeting between the investor's fiduciary facilitators and  the funding receiver after signing (MOU) the (ROI) should not be  less than3% per annum if it's a loan or direct project financing.

Prussia cited its centuries-old dynastic claims on parts of Silesia as a casus belli; but Realpolitik and geostrategic factors also played a role in provoking the conflict. Maria Theresa's contested succession to the Habsburg Monarchy under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 provided an opportunity for Prussia to strengthen itself relative to regional rivals such as Saxony and Bavaria.   All three wars are generally considered to have ended in Prussian victories; and the first resulted in Austria's cession of the majority of Silesia to Prussia. Prussia emerged from the Silesian Wars as a new European great power and the leading state of Protestant Germany; while Catholic Austria's defeat by a lesser German power significantly damaged the House of Habsburg's prestige. The conflict over Silesia foreshadowed a wider Austro-Prussian struggle for hegemony over the German-speaking peoples; which would later culminate in the Austro-Prussian War of 186

In 1933; Stiles and Crawford accidentally discovered that the light sensitivity differed for rays entering through center versus those entering from peripheral regions of the eye. The efficiency of the rays is less when the rays enter via the peripheral region because the shape of the cone cells that collect the incident quanta are different from cone receptors in the center of the eye. This effect can cause both positive and negative chromostereopsis depending on the position of the pupil. If the pupil is centered on optical axis; it causes positive chromostereopsis. However; if the pupil is significantly off-center from the optical axis; negative chromostereopsis will ensue. Because most people have a point of maximum luminous efficiency that is off-center; the Stiles-Crawford Effects generally will have antagonistic chromostereoptic effects. Therefore; instead of seeing red in front of blue; blue will be seen in front of red and the effect will be reversed. The Stiles-Crawford effect also explains why positive chromostereopsis is decreased when illumination is lowered. At lower illumination; the dilation of pupil increases the pupillary peripheral region and therefore increases the magnitude of the Stiles-Crawford eff

SPAM,          KEVIN GEORGE   ABIDJAN;COTE D'IVORIE WEST AFRICA   Dearest one;   Although we have not met; I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was; until recently; a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone;West Africa.  Early in January last year; the rebels in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father; King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.   Fortunately for me; I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed; I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money; according to the docement; was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father;when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document; I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next of kin to my father.   But deliberatley; I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping me to solve this my problem. Most importantly;Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing. Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684 I remain yours sincerely;   KEVIN GEORGE

HAM,          Not true on the choice part.   After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want their ?1800 worth of router and firewall nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.   I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for); but a Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....   Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I wanted....................................

With the Waldseemuller map; the New World was born. But there was something else. What would later come to be called South America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped; not only on the east coast; where explorers had already sailed; but also on the west coast

Tim: After 2 hours of            talking up at the podium; sometimes you leave a few details            out. Doom 3 multiplayer will be fully scalable. It will be a            peer to peer system. We haven't started working on it yet.            Tell everyone not to panic - it will be fine. John just forgot            to mention it'll be scalable past four players. It's hard to            give a hard number because we haven't started working on            it yet. Right now we're focused on making Doom 3 a            kickass; over the top single player game." http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

HAM,        Heh; ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not  "parroting the party line".   It was even less so thirty years ago. My story remains the same; take it  or leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to  suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish; etc. etc.:   I don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend  to the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you  say it; even in France. I don't care where the political pendulum has  swung currently.

HAM,     "Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton"

"" current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings .  but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s  concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things  get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then  pg & e will be left holding the bag .  thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is  demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of  jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative  demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must  "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .  the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they  think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for  davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but  not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative .  remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will  be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution .  on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives  the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads .  ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 %  above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done ,  anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through  the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .  ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion  loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .  ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving .  thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior  political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they  come up with something even more outrageous . ""  pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good  for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .  davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year  while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts  for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will  accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires .  that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .  ferc  the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal  energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that  ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but  they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs  off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what  anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three  possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is  opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that  davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .  one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman  curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not  be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other  appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and  one of them "" could easily become chairman .

SPAM,        Hi!    Unfortunately; I have some bad news for you. Several months ago; I got access to the device you are using to browse the internet. Since that time; I have been monitoring your internet activity.    Being a regular visitor of adult websites; I can confirm that it is you who is responsible for this.  To keep it simple; the websites you visited provided me with access to your data.    I've uploaded a Trojan horse on the driver basis that updates its signature several times per day; to make it impossible for antivirus to detect it. Additionally; it gives me access to your camera and microphone. Moreover; I have backed-up all the data; including photos; social media; chats and contacts.    Just recently; I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen; while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!    Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks; and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.    With that in mind; here is my proposal:  Transfer the amount equivalent to 1500 USD to my Bitcoin wallet; and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.    In my opinion; this is a somewhat modest price for my work.  You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing; seeing that it's not very difficult.   My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 16EuKQaCEEeba1Us68P9RwKjc8HTT4zWRR   You have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:    It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically. It makes no sense to complain either; since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.  Everything has been orchestrated precisely.    If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared; and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that; the video will be posted on the web!   P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).   Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck; next time please be careful.

Although their spread can have beneficial aspects; invasive species adversely affect the invaded habitats and bioregions; causing ecological; environmental; and/or economic damage. Sometimes the term is used for native species that invade human habitats and become invasive pests. In the 21st century they have become a serious economic; social; and environmental threat.   Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms is a natural phenomenon; but human-facilitated introductions have greatly increased the rate; scale; and geographic range of invasion. For millennia; humans have served as both accidental and deliberate dispersal agents; beginning with our earliest migrations; accelerating in the age of discovery; and accelerating again with international trade. Notable examples of invasive plant species include the kudzu vine; Andean pampas grass; English ivy; Japanese knotweed; and yellow starthistle. Animal examples include the New Zealand mud snail; feral pig; European rabbit; grey squirrel; domestic cat; carp; and ferret. Some popular reference sources now name Homo sapiens; especially modern-age humans; as an invasive species; but broad appreciation of human learning capacity and our behavioral potential and plasticity argues against any such fixed categoriz

SPAM,            I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.   I'm ambitious; but extremely lazy; and I make over  $250;000 a year.  Are you curious yet?   In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret; it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...   You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online; but you thought they  were the big corporate execs; famous programmers; or boy-geniuses.   Well; grasshopper; think again ...   It's people like you and me that are making the real money.  Yep; people like YOU AND ME!   Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999; small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500  companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.   Today small business owners and ordinary folks  like you and me can use the web to achieve complete  financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little  work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing  technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.   If you've ever recieved an email advertisement; then  you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on  DELETE fast enough for most of those ads; right? You might not want their product; but remember that  thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a  percentage game - every bulker who contacts you  makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I  guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and  review some numbers ...   If you sell on eBay; you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days.  Using bulk email; YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100;000 emails or 100 million emails; the price is the same. ZERO!   Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad!   Imagine that you have a decent product with a  profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send  an email ad to 500;000 people; and only one person  in a thousand actually places an order; then you just  generated 500 orders and made $10;000 in a few hours  of work.     It's that simple ...   All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.   The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't  matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student  using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old  executive working from an office building in New  York City.  Anyone; and I repeat ANYONE; can start  bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All  it takes is a  few days of study; plenty of ambition;  and some basic familiarity with the Internet.   I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the  "Dot Com" mania; and I've never looked back.  I  started with no money; no product to sell; and only  the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an  opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later;  I bought my own home - with CASH.     You don't need any money.  You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.     If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!   I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of them; then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100;000 using bulk email this year.   Here goes ...   Do you have basic experience with the web?  Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time?   Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards  complete financial freedom?     If you answer YES to these questions; you could be making $5;000 - $20;000 per week working from your  home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats  the 9-5 daily grind!   All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work to make big bucks; but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do      You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.   Don't worry; it's not! I will show you step-by-step  how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business.  You'll be generating  orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.   Okay; so what if you don't have anything to sell?   No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because they have  nothing to sell; but I'm removing that hurdle right now.   After reading the Bulkbook; you can build your complete  product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE  not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within  seven days. In fact ...   I personally guarantee that you will start your own  bulk email campaign less than a week after reading  the Bulkbook!

This seperate guide contains a daily  routine for you to follow with specific; exact  instructions on how to get started.  On day one; for  example; I teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing  list.  On the seventh day; you just click send!  Your  very first campaign is ready to go.   As a special bonus; you'll recieve a FREE copy  of our STEALTH MASS MAILER; a very powerful bulk  email program which retails for $49.99!

HAM,        http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722   Pro-hunt activists target top sight   ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate. Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the night. In another incident; the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure; which is thought to represent a Celtic god or tribal symbol. Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radical alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images. The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in 1857. But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse Association; who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet. John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets. "It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards; which will help turn the white horse grey. It will not get another refit for another year. "Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or a lorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off." The sculpture needs constant work because; unlike chalk horses in the south of England; it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening. Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration; which means it will need more work next time. "We would have more sympathy if; having made the point; they would come to take it away again because it was a major job." Andy Wilson; chief executive of the North York Moors National Park; said: "It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There has not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. It would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand." An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches don't seem to be doing anything good." The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action. Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident." The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

HAM,     Subject: status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with  well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet .  an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .

HAM,     Subject: sap timesheets  hello everyone :  thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to  save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with  the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical  order  by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .  the spreadsheet is saved in o : \ research \ common \ sap timesheets \ mmm - dd .  ( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time  period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save  it .  if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,  family  time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes  have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies .  if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time  or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .  there is no code for non - exempt overtime .  this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to  fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will  try and remind you by email the day before .  i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any  other  off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you .  if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .  thanks !  shirley

HAM,     Subject: var for cob 28 th july 2000  hi all ,  i have run the var model for the positions at close fo business 28 th of july .  the model is attached below .  as a summary the results are as follows :  and as a comparison the previous days figures were :  this shows some increase in var for aluminium , copper and lead . the prices  for gold and cocoa beans have not been updated  as we still do not have a live feed to bloomberg / reuters . i will be working  on this with cantekin and andreas should also be able to  provide some more historical data .  also , after having a discussion with andreas here in london we should  probably reduce the vol we are using for tc - we are taking the cu price  vol as a proxy which is a too high . however , assuming the the other  assumptions we have made around the tc ( ie simulating a parallel shift in  the curve and  including no term structure to the price curve ) the vol estimate is a  conservative one .  cheers  kirstee

SPAM,        <http://tomsane.tk/bgware-owner@lists.untroubled.org>     Life has many ways of testing a person's will; either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.    All you can change is yourself; but sometimes that changes everything!    With everything that has happened to you; you can either feel sorry for yourself or treat what has happened as a gift. Everything is either an opportunity to grow or an obstacle to keep you from growing. You get to choose.    When the world pushes you to your knees; you're in the perfect position to pray.

SPAM,        Some more afterthoughts on my research that came to me:   In the early indie homecomputing environment such as Amiga we see anti-schi= zophrenic designs; and an anti-pop ("nerd") culture; that also is anti-schi= zophrenic.   Lesser schizophrenia seems to be based in un-accurate thinking. Greater Sch= izophrenia is drug-based and cannot be cured. Lesser Schizophrenia can be d= efeated to some extent; maybe wholly; and a computer programmer needs to ha= ve accurate thinking; for a good O.S. That is why we see a popular anti-sch= izophrenic culture such as The Amiga; be accurate in thinking; and of high = quality. And remembered for this.   Unfortunately the drinking culture of Amiga was that of daily tavern visits=  which was reflected in atleast common weekend partying for many of its fan= s; making way for windows which was atleast as drunk.   In 2000; we see the peoples belief move further toward popculture as popula= rity becomes great; and so the anti-schizophrenic angle is lost. And typica= lly the LSD/Psilocybin angle gets greater. Clearly see in Apple Mac. And St= eve Jobs (rip); still selling flashy phones.   So I have included the forementioned cider; as this is the mushroom god red= uced to Cider; which is the least one can do; and needs to have popularity = of its kind; taking over this again; with an anti-schizophrenic measure; mo= re like that of The Amiga; but now being the Source Available Unix-derivati= ve I am working on.   Furthermore historically the mushroom god was reduced to minimal; the regre= ssions of Adams god to Odn; and then Tor; which the Varangers again changed=  to Tyr; which is an empty concept; as much as a god can be.   Tyr again still compatbile with the kind of quality measures we want; and V= aranger culture; a big culture wanting so.   And what if we further change the useless threeletter gods to an economic s= ystem; which CAN be three letters. Indeed if you want serious religion they=  you need a 500-page book like The Quran; and ALLAH.   Three letters will never be this; nor a mushroom regressed bible.   And Varanger culture indeed was more like muslims; having once believed in = Adams god.   A computer OS with up and download of files; can be a three letter system; = and I have renamed it to TSX O.S.  "Transaction Streaming Unix-derivative".=  Supporting all ciderproduction in the world; for a an anti-schizophrenic f= orce; as much as can be in pop culture.   Still ofcourse with the fair pay princples this began with. So much better = than regressed churches and facist kings. Let this money stream through her= e instead; For The People; as a democracy supposedly should be.   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3gmLVjHS5A702wo4bol_Q   Truly Peace; Ywe.

To pick an obvious example.; if you want to do linear     R> algebra; then Java isn't a serious candidate at all.   If you want to do http; C gets pretty muddy (curl is about the best choice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all and end-all.   I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for 24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.     As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox; as much as I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs; I've never ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be responsible for something you are actually responsible for; and I am so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.   Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about; but I've been using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc; which is by no means perfect; Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party libs; second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really hate with a passion; yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.   For example; take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll together a telnet client with a tokenizer; perl-regex preprocessing a stream to produce parseable XML; project that XML into relational databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema; and open an XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where can I find C libs for those components?     On the webserver; we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database; presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms; and again; where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge but Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting; but it's not ready for prime-time; and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.   When you need C libs; or even C++ libs; where's the best place to shop? Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and trying it out?   In a perfect universe; I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby; but I don't see the social infrastructure for either happening during my professional lifetime.

Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly  exasperated Rumsfeld and their "UN Inspections not war" banner. That picture will be dominating the news cycles in China; Iraq; Russia; Germany; and  France; at least. For goodness sakes; you're arguing about it on FoRK. In  politics by sound-bite; those two rude hags kicked ass and took names.   For the record; I don't think they even got arrested; which is a shame. It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself; get your point on the nightly news; spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.

SPAM,         I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of health; since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am Mrs.Carlsen Monika John  from Denmark wife of late Mr Monika John ; a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband; the sum of ($ 11.000.000 ;elevenmilliondollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition; I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works; for orphanages; widows and also  build schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this project; and I will give you more information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your reply.   May God bless you and your family. Regards; Mrs.Carlsen Monika John written from Hospital.

HAM,        Definitional nit to pick:   Robert Harley writes: > It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly; > precisely identical between males and females.   > Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.   You've redefined "promiscuity" above as "total" or "average"  activity; which seems to rob it of its common meaning:  activity above some specific threshold (usually "one") or  norm; or involving extra or indiscriminate variety.  "Promiscuity" is thus inherently a description of  distributions rather than averages.   Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. Then; let one of the males also have  sex with the other two females.    Sure; the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes; tautologically.    But here more women than men are:  - above the single partner threshold  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners   And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2)  number of partners.   So in this contrived population; females are more  "promiscuous" than males; unless "promiscuity" is  defined uselessly.  
HAM,        from slate's "today's papers":   The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest national gas pipeline company; El Paso; illegally withheld gas from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01. The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity in the state off-line; thus driving up the price of gas and helping to induce rolling blackouts.    and this is the product of overregulation?

operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon ."

HAM,          For anyone to fully bury global warming; they would have to bury the Greens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth; it is to industrial civilization.   The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.   Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming; people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the "Medieval Warm Period".  Said period was warmer than what we have now; and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.   In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does; and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.   Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.   More water vapor can increase temperatuers; but that also leads to more clouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it; so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.

HAM,     Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .
