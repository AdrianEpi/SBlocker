Generates vocabulary, corpus, learns and classifies a text into different types of data. ~\newline


Runs the program with the needed flag for generating vocabulary (-\/v $\vert$$\vert$ --vocabulary), generating corpus (-\/co $\vert$$\vert$ --corpus), learning probabilities (-\/l $\vert$$\vert$ --learner), printing user manual (-\/h $\vert$$\vert$ --help), classifying test data (-\/cl $\vert$$\vert$ --classify), calculating success and error percentage (-\/e $\vert$$\vert$ --error), updating emails database (-\/u $\vert$$\vert$ --update\+Database), generating tests files (-\/t $\vert$$\vert$ --generate\+Test).

\begin{DoxyVerb}    -v      (--vocabulary) generates the vocabulary from the input file into
            the output file, excluding words in reserved words file.

            Example: 
                $ Sblocker -v inputFile outputFile rwFile

            Definition:
                inputFile   File path with the full data that wants to be processed.
                outputFile  File path were the program will store the solution.
                rwFile      File path were the reserved words are stored.


    -co     (--corpus) generates one different corpus per each data type 
            received as argument after the input file and the reserved words 
            file.  

            Example:
                $ Sblocker -co inputFile rwFile Corpus1 Corpus2 ... CorpusX

            Definition:
                inputFile   File path with the full data that wants to be processed.
                rwFile      File path were the reserved words are stored.
                CorpusX     Name of the data type that wants to be searched and generated
                            corpus at. The input file must have them on the first column
                            and separating the rest of the line with a ",", as if it were
                            at the first column of a csv.


    -h      (--help) prints the user manual for the program.

            Example:
                $ testClassifier -h


    -l      (--learner) calculates the proabilities for each token for each corpus and
            stores it into files named as learned_CORPUS.txt on the output folder.

            Example: 
                $ Sblocker -l vocFile Corpus1 Corpus2 ... CorpusX

            Definition:
                vocFile     Vocabulary file generated with --vocabulary option
                CorpusX     Name of the data type that wants to be searched and generated
                            corpus at. The input file must have them on the first column
                            and separating the rest of the line with a ",", as if it were
                            at the first column of a csv.

    -cl     (--classify) classifies the given input into the created classes readed
            from the learned data.

            Example:
                $ Sblocker -cl corpusTest rwFile Learn1 Learn2 ... LearnN

            Definition:
                corpusTest  File path which has one sentence thata is going to be classified
                            on each line.
                rwFile      File path were the reserved words are stored.
                LearnN      File path with the learned output data from using -l option.


    -e      (--error) calulates the error and success percentage of the classification.

            Example: 
                $ Sblocker -e resumeData expectResume

            Definition:
                resumeData  File path to the resume generated by classifier.
                expectData  File path to the expected data, it must be with the same syntax
                            as resumeData (one line per sentence class and in same order as
                            origin corpusTest).


    -u      (--updateDatabase) Updates the emails database by adding
            all the emails in the folder inputs/GenerateMails to database.


    -t      (--generateTest) Generate the test files for the program,
                takes 20% random data from mail-train.csv for geting this
                tests.
